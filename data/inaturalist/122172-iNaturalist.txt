"Pyrisitia lisa","2015-08-02 00:00:00 -0600","2 August 2015: Observed a Little Yellow (Pyrisitia lisa) next to the Elm Fork Trinity River at Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA) in Lewisville, Texas.

The Massachusetts Audubon posts a complete note on the distribution or range of the Little Yellow in North America. They write that the Little Yellow or Little Sulphur is a ""largely tropical species, residing year round from Costa Rica north through Mexico and the Caribbean to the southeastern United States from east Texas to southeastern Virginia. An abundant species throughout most of its breeding range, the Little Yellow disperses northward each summer and fall, frequently reaching the northern Great Plain states and southern Canada east to Nova Scotia. It is not able to overwinter north of about 40 degrees N. Lat., but individuals arriving northward early enough in the season and finding a supply of an appropriate food plant, are able to produce a single brood. The species has reproduced in southern Connecticut but so far cannot survive the winter. It reaches the rest of New England only irregularly, becoming increasingly rare northward."" 

The Little Yellow's northernmost range is Nova Scotia in Canada and its southernmost range is Costa Rica in Central America where it flies year-round northward into Mexico. Little Yellow takes flight through South Texas and eastern New Mexico toward the eastern half of the United States and north toward the southeastern provinces of Canada and New England in the United States. This is one butterfly species that is also native to the Caribbean.

Because it ranges over vast parts of the North American continent this is most certainly an authentic butterfly of the Western Hemisphere.","Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA), Lewisville, Texas",33.067352,-96.963444,"Little Yellow (Pyrisitia lisa), Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA), Lewisville, Texas. butterflies, summer, range, Massachusetts Audubon, Costa Rica, Central America, Caribbean, Mexico, Texas, eastern United States, New England, North America","Little Yellow","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1828798","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/2219882/medium.jpg?1438634803","aguilita",1828798,"Little Yellow (Pyrisitia lisa)","Insecta",122172,"false",5,0,"2015-08-02","2015-08-02","","Central Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"false","","",NA,115129,"2015-08-03 13:46:05 -0700","2017-09-25 19:43:36 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
