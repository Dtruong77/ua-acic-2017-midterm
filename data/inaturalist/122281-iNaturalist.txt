This one has a flame red band on its lower part of the wing and is a greenish color. I had an interesting looking front and head section. This guy was proving to be a challenge to photograph. The closer I got the farther it would get. I finally had the perfect angle to where I would get the full butterfly in this preferred shot. This thing was sure stripy on his antenna and his legs. These things are pretty cool and a bit of a switch up from my other observations of Hairstreaks. I am very thrilled to add this one to the old life list. ","Elmer W.

Anybody know what these flowers are called? One of the plantings in the butterfly park --  upright herbs, ~1' tall, with these clusters of flowers on top. Flowers are 1 cm across.  I bet someone in Gardening for Wildlife will know! EDIT:  Gooseneck Loosestrife (Lysimachia clethroides).  Flickr comes through again; thanks to Zunzuncito for the ID.

From <a href=""http://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.butterfliesandmoths.org/</a>:

&quot;Caterpillar hosts: Fallen leaves of wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), dwarf sumac (Rhus copallina [present at this site]), staghorn sumac (R. typhina), and several oaks [plenty of oaks around, I'm sure].

Adult food: Flower nectar from yarrow, wild cherry, tickseed sunflower, sumac, sweet pepperbush, New Jersey tea, common milkweed [present at this site], and dogbane [abundant].&quot;
