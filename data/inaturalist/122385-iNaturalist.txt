Aggregate Ponds (Milepost 118 of the North Cascades Highway)
About one mile west of the Goodell Creek Campground is the entrance road to these human-made ponds. Material dredged from this area was used in the construction of SR 20. Now the ponds are excellent birding areas. Keep in mind that these ponds are owned by Seattle City Light and vehicle access is not permitted. Park at least fifty feet from the gate and continue on foot.
