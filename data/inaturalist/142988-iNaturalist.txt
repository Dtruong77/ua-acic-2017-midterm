"Lerema accius","2017-04-16 20:04:00 -0500","Day 3 of City Nature Challenge (Easter)…  Today I decided to just go solo into the Fort Worth Nature Center.  I sure had a nice time going to some places I hadn’t been before.  I wasn’t able to stay out all day (family stuff this evening), but I did see quite a few things I hadn’t seen before.  

Will work on all of these ID’s later on – just wanted to upload them first.

Locations approximate for each observation (normally I try to get a little more specific, but I was all over the place on these days!).

The Clouded Skipper we observed at TWU was feeding on Texas Lantana, which is one of its host plants. Clouded Skipper ranges far and wide in both North and South America. In North America its outer northern range occurs in the vicinity of the Great Lakes including states like Illinois and Ohio thence east to the Atlantic Coast encompassing states like West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland. It does not extend north of this line of states in the United States apparently (according to the BugGuide data or range map) but occurs south of these states to Florida and west to Texas and Arizona. It doesn’t appear to occur in Canada. But its range extends far toward the south passing through Mexico, Central America and into South America where its southern range extends as far as Colombia and Venezuela at the northwestern end of the continent. Because of its extensive range north and south, Clouded Skipper is clearly an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere.

26 September 2014: Not 100 yards from our backdoor on Cooper Creek and adjoining Avondale Park in Denton, Texas we came upon a male Clouded Skipper (Lerema accius) that was taking in the sun and moisture available at the site. The range of the Clouded Skipper is from the “southeastern United States to northern South America. It is occasional up through coastal New England and from there flies inland to Indiana and Missouri,” to paraphrase the short description found at BugGuide. At the Dallas County Lepidopterists’ Society, they note that Clouded Skipper flies throughout the North Texas metropolitan area from March through December. Here’s the classification for Clouded Skipper presented at BugGuide:

Classification 
Kingdom Animalia (Animals) 
Phylum Arthropoda (Arthropods) 
Subphylum Hexapoda (Hexapods) 
Class Insecta (Insects) 
Order Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths) 
Superfamily Hesperioidea (Skippers) 
Family Hesperiidae (Skippers) 
Subfamily Hesperiinae (Grass Skippers) 
Genus Lerema 
Species accius (Clouded Skipper)
