Medina River Natural Area 
San Antonio, Béxar County, Texas

Note: This was an exceptional park and/or natural area. Our tree and shrub IDs were obtained from the extensive educational markers found at the site. Lots of thought and resources went into making sure that the ninety-some educational markers found throughout the site occur naturally where the trees and shrubs that are described are part of the existing landscape. The Medina River Natural Area is administered by the City of San Antonio, Texas. 

It is Celia's Roadside Skipper, and I documented it at the site on the same date.

2 April 2017 
Medina River Natural Area 
San Antonio, Béxar County, Texas

Note: This was an exceptional park and/or natural area. Our tree and shrub IDs were obtained from the extensive educational markers found at the site. Lots of thought and resources went into making sure that the ninety-some educational markers found throughout the site occur naturally where the trees and shrubs that are described are part of the existing landscape. The Medina River Natural Area is administered by the City of San Antonio, Texas. 

Celia's Roadside-Skipper was found perched on Giant Ragweed not far from the site’s garden. This is the second iNat record of this skipper species in Béxar County, Texas: https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=2685&taxon_id=148862

Source: Within the United States Celia's Roadside-Skipper (Amblyscirtes celia) is found exclusively within Texas in a south-north line running from South Texas to North Texas and east to the Houston area and points in between. See the range map in the North American Moth Photographer’s Group: http://mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu/large_map.php?hodges=4106
