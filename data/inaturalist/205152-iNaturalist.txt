http://www.lcra.org/parks/developed-parks/Pages/mckinney-roughs-nature-park.aspx
The park is owned and managed by the L.C.R.A. (Lower Colorado River Authority). Nick was very gracious and gave us a good tour of the park and we found a bunch of things to iNat as well as a new odonate or two for the park.

Rare species in central Texas; this species usually only seen in the lower Rio Grande Valley within Texas. @ncowey has had several recently here and we were fortunate to be able to take some shots of one today.
