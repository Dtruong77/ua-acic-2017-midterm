"Oarisma edwardsii","2016-07-27 09:26:00 -0500","I need help with this Oarisma skipperling.  @robberfly?  Based on the very plain greenish-yellow HW underside, I'm inclined to call this Edward's Skipperling rather than Garita.  The fringe seems mostly white, however.  Both are mapped (in Brock & Kaufman) as ranging into n.e. New Mexico.  It was photographed in fairly open pinyon oak woodland (2nd growth after a hot wildfire 5 yrs ealier) on the Coal Camp Trail in Sugarite Canyon at about 7,200 ft elevation.","Sugarite Canyon SP, Colfax Co., NM",36.9435638889,-104.3772638889,"Butterfly, NM","Edwards's Skipperling","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3862219","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/4525701/medium.jpg?1470946060","gcwarbler",3862219,"Edwards's Skipperling","Insecta",226070,"false",1,0,"2016/07/27 9:26 AM CDT","2016-07-27","2016-07-27 07:26:00 -0700","Central Time (US & Canada)",100,NA,NA,"false",NA,NA,NA,27047,"2016-08-11 13:32:10 -0700","2017-10-13 20:39:54 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
