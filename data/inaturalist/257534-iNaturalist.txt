"Panoquina hecebolus","2016-11-18 08:58:00 -0600","I was with a group of butterfly people who are all a good bit more knowledgeable than I am on butterflies. That is likely the only reason I was able to see this Hecebolus Skipper which is a rare stray to south Texas from Mexico. Identified, seen and photographed by about 10 folks, then it was lost from view. Very similar to another rare stray called Purple-washed Skipper which we also saw, but I was not able to get photos of that one today.","Mission, TX, USA",26.1768633333,-98.3659016667,NA,"Hecebolus Skipper","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/4597686","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/5557305/medium.jpg?1479527346","greglasley",4597686,"Hecebolus Skipper","Insecta",257534,"false",1,0,"2016/11/18 8:58 AM CST","2016-11-18","2016-11-18 07:58:00 -0700","Central Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"false",NA,NA,NA,9706,"2016-11-18 21:07:27 -0700","2017-06-20 22:08:37 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
