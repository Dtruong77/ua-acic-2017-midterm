"Erynnis horatius","2017-07-27 12:49:00 -0500","We are in a very hot period with intense sun and temps in the upper 90s and low 100s F. When photographing Erynnis one of the usual problems is getting a view of the underwing. Not so today with this one, as it is so hot and sunny that every time it landed, it would almost immediately close its wings to limit exposure to the sun. This allowed me to get a few underwing shots showing that the underside of the hindwing lacks the two spots usually on Juvenal's Duskywing. Combined with the upper wing pattern I think this is is Horace's Duskywing. @nlblock, does that look right to you?","Hays County, TX, USA",30.1985212293,-98.1138564349,"","Horace's Duskywing","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7235543","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/9344229/medium.jpg?1501179814","greglasley",7235543,"Horace's Duskywing","Insecta",50071,"false",3,0,"2017/07/27 12:49 PM CDT","2017-07-27","2017-07-27 10:49:00 -0700","Central Time (US & Canada)",8,"","","false","","",NA,9706,"2017-07-27 11:30:09 -0700","2017-09-12 07:29:13 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"

Greenbelt Corridor Ray Roberts/Lewisville Lake FM 428 Access Area, Aubrey Branch
Denton County, Texas

Horace's Duskywing flies in Texas from March through November (based on the BugGuide data map). The one presented in this observation is a male that's feeding on Arrowleaf Clover. In general, Horace's Duskywing's range in North America extends from Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico in the West of the United States, east to Texas and thence north and east all the way to Ontario, Canada, and Florida, respectively. Because of its flight in the Southwest of the US, it's most likely that Horace's Duskywing's flight includes parts of northern Mexico. Because of its extensive flight in North America, Horace's Duskywing is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department administers the Greenbelt Corridor FM 428 Access Area.

12 September 2015: This is the second observation we post to iNaturalist of this particular butterfly species. Horace's Duskywing (Erynnis horatius) is considered a large skipper and can grow up to 1.5 to 2.0"" across from one tip of its wings to the other. Horace’s Duskywing’s range extends throughout most of the eastern two-thirds of the United States encompassing 37 states and the District of Columbia from the Great Lakes to the Río Bravo/Río Grande (north and south) and from the Colorado River to the Atlantic Ocean (east and west) generally speaking. The western third of the nation generally does not provide a home for Horace’s Duskywing’s range but it does fly south through Texas at least into northeastern Mexico. The nationally-limited range maps we consulted online for this butterfly do not discuss the range beyond the national borders of the United States and so we fail to understand fully the extent of its range to the south of the U.S.-Mexico border. But because Horace’s Duskywing is most definitely a North American butterfly it is and has long been an original authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. This particular observation of Horace’s Duskywing was made in one of the flower gardens at the main campus of Texas Woman’s University (TWU) in Denton, Texas.

We acknowledge and thank Dr. Cliff Ivy who is a contributing editor at BugGuide for making the positive ID of our observation of Horace’s Duskywing. That ID can be accessed online here: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1181699

25 July 2014: During the last few weeks of summer several interesting butterflies appeared on Cooper Creek next to Avondale Park in Denton, Texas. One of these that appeared and which we observed and photographed was Horace's Duskywing (Erynnis horatius). For being a skipper, this one had its wings wide open and offered us a complete view of its dorsal side. If one goes online to research skippers in particular one will find that most of the pics will not show them with their wings spread completely open as our images do for this observation. We don't know why this happens suffice to say that it is simply noted in the course of our online research that this is the case. Happily, we have the image that shows the Horace's Duskywing with its dorsal side in plain view for all to see and identify. 

In deciding on the IDentity of this skipper we judged it to be Horace's Duskywing but we looked closely at the Meridian Duskywing (Erynnis meridianus) as well but decided in the end that based on the rest of the mottled markings of the dorsal wings presented by the specimen in our observation, that it was a Horace's Duskywing and not Meridian Duskywing. The Meridian Duskywing has more of a reddish-brown color to its dorsal presentation than Horace's Duskywing does in our view and is absent the mottled look referred to. Meridian Duskywing according to the Dallas County Lepidopterists' Society does occur occasionally in Dallas County and North Texas as a ""stray"" and their last documented instance of it occurred in October 2002, thirteen years ago.  I wouldn't call it a ""stray"" as they do perhaps; I'd call it more like rare.  This detail influenced our decision too. Horace's Duskywing is considered a large skipper and can grow up to 1.5 to 2.0"" across from one tip of its wing to the other.

To access the images for the two Duskywings (Horace and Meridian) we examined consult the section below on sources. We have provided a brief explanation and the respective links to the various sources for all to access and learn from as we did.

Horace’s Duskywing’s range extends throughout most of the eastern two-thirds of the United States encompassing 37 states and the District of Columbia from the Great Lakes to the Río Bravo/Río Grande (north and south) and from the Colorado River to the Atlantic Ocean (east and west) generally speaking. The western third of the nation generally does not provide a home for Horace’s Duskywing’s range but it does fly south through Texas at least into northeastern Mexico. The nationally-limited range maps we consulted online for this butterfly do not discuss the range beyond the national borders of the United States and so we fail to understand fully the extent of its range to the south of the U.S.-Mexico border. But because Horace’s Duskywing is most definitely a North American butterfly it is and has long been an original authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere.

Avondale Park and Cooper Creek are both administered by the City of Denton, Texas.
