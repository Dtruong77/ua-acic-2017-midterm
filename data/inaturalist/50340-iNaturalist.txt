"Hylephila phyleus","2016-09-06 09:52:52 -0500","This is a Skipper which may look like a cross between a butterfly and a moth. It is in the same family of Leopdaptra. They are active during the time butterflies are out. They are small and compact and keep their winds up like butterflies. This guy was about an inch long and was vibrantly colored. It had a wealth of orange, yellow, and black colors. It was a beautiful specimen but was hard to spot in the flowerbed. It was very cooperative and let me get several photos of him. He was sitting very still on a leaf. I don't know if it was sick or dying but it didn't attempt to fly he did move a little but it was puzzling. He was in fact very beautiful. Skippers always seem to fascinate me. I like the way that are shaped. They seem to be nor of Butterfly or Moth but rather a mix of the two like I said earlier on this post.

Greenbelt Corridor Ray Roberts/Lewisville Lake FM 428 Access Area, Aubrey Branch
Denton County, Texas

Fiery Skipper is perhaps the most common or widely known of the Skipper butterflies in the United States. The one presented in this observation is that of a female, which had stopped to rest before it continued on its way. In Texas (per the BugGuide data map), Fiery Skipper flies from January through December. Fiery Skipper flies in most of the United States including in the Northwest from Oregon to Massachusetts in New England, and thence on into Ontario, Canada. It also flies throughout most of the Americas as its flight takes it through Mexico, Central America, and into South America as far south as Argentina. Fiery Skipper is one of the quintessential American butterflies, in the hemispheric sense of the word. Because of its extensive flight it goes without saying that Fiery Skipper is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. The Greenbelt Corridor FM 428 Access Area is administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

"Hylephila phyleus","2015-10-28 00:00:00 -0600","Fiery Skipper (Hylephila phyleus) - male

28 October 2015: Walked the three-mile loop of trails at the Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center in Denton, Texas, and on the Wetlands Trail at several places found that Honey Bee and Skippers were busy nectaring at blooming white wildflower we have yet to ID. This male Fiery Skipper (Hylephila phyleus) was photographed on the Wetlands Trail. We want to acknowledge our colleagues at BugGuide nature4me and Dr. Cliff Ivy for confirming the IDentification of this particular specimen including its gender. The BugGuide ID can be accessed here: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1160329

The range map provided at BugGuide based on observations submitted by those who use this service and platform to report their observations indicates that Fiery Skipper flies in about two-thirds of the states in the United States and parts of central Canada. Because all of the states bordering with Mexico report Fiery Skipper we can deduce that Fiery Skipper flies in Mexico too but the extent of its range in Mexico and/or beyond to the south is undetermined. However, because it flies extensively in North America, Fiery Skipper is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.

Fiery Skipper (Hylephila phyleus)

2 July 2014: Walking the trail at North Lakes Park we came upon this mating pair of Fiery Skippers (Hylephila phyleus) in the tall reeds growing by the side of the (northside) lake at North Lakes Park in Denton, Texas. 

Fiery Skipper is a North American butterfly found in the United States and Mexico. In the US the Fiery Skipper may be found from California on the West Coast to southern New England on the East Coast and most of the continental US in between in one way or another experiences the presence of this small skipper including the southern reaches of the Great Lakes and states adjoining these. Fiery Skipper is found throughout the Southwest and ranges southward into the central Mexican states. On the Pacific Coast it reaches southward to Jalisco and thence eastward to the area of northern Veracruz or southern Tamaulipas reaching those states in between these two points. The south central and southernmost states of Mexico apparently are not included in the Fiery Skipper's range to the south. Because it is a skipper familiar to the peoples of both Mexico and United States Fiery Skipper is a bonafide resident of the Western Hemisphere.

North Lakes Park is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.

Note: There are some slight discrepancies between the two range maps presented in the sources cited for this particular skipper. The differences are rather compatible ones and to be expected when all maps are projections of information through the eyes of the mapmaker, whomever they happen to be.

For the ButterflySCAN project, I have been assigned a location to explore every two weeks. My site is called Solano Canyon and is located northwest of downtown Los Angeles. (I enjoy this activity so much that sometimes I go every week, or every week-and-a-half, rather than waiting the full two weeks.) During my outing I walk through the neighborhood looking for, and counting, the various butterflies that I encounter. I also try to get photos of the butterflies that I see. (This photo is one that I took recently.)
