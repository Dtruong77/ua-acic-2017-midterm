The swallowtail species in the area would all eventually land on the river bank on a sandy shoreline (uncommon, mostly granite or dirt shores on this section of river) next to a flowering meadow. This made it easy to wait and catch them there. I assume this is how they drink, since they usually landed very close to the water's edge and paused for a bit before flying again.","Folsom Lake State Recreation Area, CA, US",38.772655,-121.031143,"","Anise Swallowtail","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/222953","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/280845/medium.JPG?1444798578","justin2",222953,"Anise Swallowtail (Papilio zelicaon)","Insecta",51097,"false",2,0,"March 24, 2013 17:09","2013-03-24","2013-03-24 17:09:00 -0700","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,"","","false",NA,"",NA,5692,"2013-03-25 11:23:22 -0700","2015-05-13 17:23:07 -0700","research","CC-BY",NA,"false"
