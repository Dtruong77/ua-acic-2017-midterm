18 October 2015: Walked about the Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center (CCNHC) in Denton, Texas and came upon this male Common Checkered-Skipper (Pyrgus communis) nectaring near the main entrance to the nature preserve. We make the determination of its being a male based on the male and female images for this species posted on the Dallas County Lepidopterists' Society (cited in the source section below). We had once previously made an observation of this species on July 18, 2015, to iNat, based on an observation we made on December 28, 2014, in Val Verde County, Texas, but a few miles from the Rio Grande, Common Checkered-Skipper. We recognize Dr. Cliff Ivy of BugGuide for confirming our ID of this skipper. That ID Request and confirmation can be accessed here: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1157060 . The CCNHC is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.
