"Icaricia saepiolus","2016-06-09 03:30:00 -0600","Tan colored upper side.  I couldn't get it to open wings again.  This one has me stumped.  I've had people suggested a butterfly from the Dotted-blue complex, but it just doesn't look right to me.  Anyone with more experience have any ideas?  

It was found in a dry sagebrush area with a lot of buckwheat undergrowth.     

According to Paul Opler:
A number of different blue get this sort of elongated spot pattern, but saepiolus often has the oranges spots like this one.
