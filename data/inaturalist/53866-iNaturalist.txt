7 September 2014: In what would be an excellent month for making new butterfly observations in the North Texas area we started with this one, Brazilian Skipper (Calpodes ethlius), perched soaking in the moisture at the edge of the water on Cooper Creek next to Avondale Park in Denton, Texas. The Brazilian Skipper is also known by other common names including the Canna Butterfly, Large Canna Leafroller, and the Arrowroot Butterfly. It is a widely distributed skipper throughout the North and South American continents but tends to exhibit a more southerly than northern presence. We extend our thanks to Dr. Cliff Ivy, a contributing editor at BugGuide, for his generous IDentification of this Brazilian Skipper. To access the ID online go to: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1176449

According to the University of Florida’s Department of Entomology and Nematology’s online site called “Featured Creatures,” the Brazilian Skipper’s range is such that it is considered “native to Mexico, Central America, and the northern part of the South American continent, being found as far south as the northern border of Argentina (Scudder 1889). It is found on the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean (Onore and Mielke 1988) and throughout the West Indies in the Caribbean Sea. In the United States, it is well-established in Florida, Texas, and southern Arizona (Scudder 1889). It is an occasional visitor to other Gulf coastal states and can be found in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. To date, C. ethlius has been collected in at least 24 states (see Butterflies of North America), although many of those records are considered to be ""strays"" rather than indications of establishment.”  

Here’s a description and life history of the Brazilian Skipper from Featured Creatures: “The adults of C. ethlius are brownish skipper butterflies of medium size. The female's forewing ranges from 22 to 27 mm in length while that of the male is somewhat smaller at 23 to 24 mm (Scudder 1889). The forewings are rich dark brown except for five vitreous (transparent) spots and have a fringe of dirty golden yellow hairs on the posterior margin. The hind wings are a little darker than the forewings and have three vitreous spots arranged in an almost straight line. The dorsal surface of the thorax is olive-colored while the ventral surface is yellowish gray. The abdomen is dark brown dorsally and pale yellow whitish ventrally. Adult skippers are strong, fast fliers and can usually only be collected while they nectar at flowering plants. In southern Florida, adults are usually first noticed in May with a second generation of adults appearing in early June. It is not known how many generations per year occur in Florida but adults have been collected in all months of the year (Kimball 1965) and all larval stages have been collected in January. It is thought that C. ethlius can only overwinter in the very southernmost region of Florida and must recolonize more northern regions each year (Moore 1928).” 

And the Dallas County Lepidopertists’ Society online site notes that Brazilian Skipper is abundant throughout the North Texas metropolitan area from April through October or November depending on the year. Because of its extensive presence throughout the Americas there’s no question but that the Brazilian Skipper is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. Avondale Park and Cooper Creek are administered by the City of Denton, Texas.

This is the classification for Brazilian Skipper found at BugGuide:
