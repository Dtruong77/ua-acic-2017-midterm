"Thorybes bathyllus","2017-05-13 00:00:00 -0600","Day two at the Pat Mayse WMA BioBlitz with good friends from throughout Texas. I joined about 20 folks at this Wildlife Management Area to document as much as possible, and it was fantastic. I did try to document a few things, but more important for me, I got to spend time with some of my favorite naturalists in the whole world. As I go through each of these, I smile. :)

In the morning, Some of us went to the area by the ponds to explore.
