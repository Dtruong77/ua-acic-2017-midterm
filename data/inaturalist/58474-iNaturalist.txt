"Erynnis brizo","2011-05-02 00:00:00 -0500","UPDATED:

It turns out this is actually a Sleepy Duskywing and not a Dreamy Duskywing. Two professional lepidopterists have confirmed this identification. It was noted that this fresh individual lacks the white suffusion and the sharply pointed forewing that are typical of E. icelus. Also the coloration and development of the forewing's postmedian band are more consistent with E. brizo. Sleepy Duskywing is a somewhat rare species for RI.
