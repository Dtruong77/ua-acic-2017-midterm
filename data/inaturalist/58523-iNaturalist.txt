This one is one of the more common of caterpillars i look for and often see. This thing was just hanging on for dear life in the bluster of the wind. It was hard to get a photo at times. I had to have my dad hold the plant stem to get it to stop shaking around. I don't know why it took me so long to post these but I am doing it now. I hate it when I have back draft observations on the back burner. Sometimes I just have a hard time with late photos.

They consume nectar from red clovers, milkweed, and thistles, which is what it was probably doing when I captured its picture, as it's sitting on a red clover in the grass.","Bloomington, IL, USA",40.475578745,-89.0208055852,"","Black Swallowtail","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7151918","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/9210282/medium.jpg?1500687253","tsingh",7151918,"Black Swallowtail","Insecta",58523,"false",1,0,"2017/07/19 8:34 PM CDT","2017-07-19","2017-07-19 18:34:00 -0700","Central Time (US & Canada)",180,"","","false","","",NA,541754,"2017-07-21 18:42:34 -0700","2017-07-27 18:22:49 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"

Medina River Natural Area 
San Antonio, Béxar County, Texas

Note: This was an exceptional park and/or natural area. Our tree and shrub IDs were obtained from the extensive educational markers found at the site. Lots of thought and resources went into making sure that the ninety-some educational markers found throughout the site occur naturally where the trees and shrubs that are described are part of the existing landscape. The Medina River Natural Area is administered by the City of San Antonio, Texas.

I am the same way with baby birds and things that are hard to ID when young. I get these guys all the time on some of the host plants I grow at my house. I normally get them on Rue and Dill or Fennel. These guys are one of my favorites to look at and they are pretty big. I need to really study up on my butterfly and moth larva. It is very important to know the baby stage of a moth or a butterfly. I am a huge butterfly and moth fanatic but some I have a really hard time identifying. These things are pretty cool.

This thing was different from the pipevine and the Eastern Tiger Swallowtails. It took me a few attempts but finally this guy decided to land and I was able to get a few photos of him. He was laying in the grass where there were no flowers to feed on. His wings were spread out which is the way I like my butterfly photos. The back wing is so much more important than the underside but both can be good for ID marks but to get the good stuff it is the upper part of the wing that is the good stuff. This one was mainly black with a series of yellow dots going in a series of two rows on the back of the wing. This guy was already showing some signs of some wear and tear but still very impressive to see. This is my third swallowtail species that I have photographed. This one is a really nice one. However the Eastern Tiger so far has been chalked up on my favorites bar but this one is nothing to sneeze at it is beautiful too. It is very pretty to look at.

At least two, possibly three, of these butterflies were seen while hiking the Tuetonia Peak Trail and try as I might, I could never catch one at rest so I have to settle with these rapid-flutter , in-flight shots.
