"Satyrium calanus","2007-06-30 14:28:29 -0400","It was a gorgeous summer afternoon, sunny &amp; warm, perfect butterfly weather, &amp; here was a great big beautiful butterflybush in full bloom.  But it didn't actually seem to be getting a lot of action.  I was bemoaning the lack of butterflies and contenting myself with shooting other pollinators when this Banded Hairstreak (lifelist species for me) landed right in front of my nose.  Notice that it's missing a chunk of tail -- the decoy 'false head' did its job.","Metuchen, New Jersey, United States",40.513786,-74.47665,"","Banded Hairstreak","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/513705","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/654219/medium.jpg?1444428205","anita363",513705,"Banded Hairstreak","Insecta",58539,"false",1,0,"2007-06-30 14:28:29","2007-06-30","2007-06-30 11:28:29 -0700","Eastern Time (US & Canada)",NA,"","","false","","",NA,3773,"2014-01-27 20:42:39 -0700","2015-09-28 20:41:53 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC-SA",NA,"false"
