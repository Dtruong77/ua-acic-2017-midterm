"Papilio glaucus","2017-07-30 16:02:07 -0400","During our trip to Hocking Hills, my friend and I were walking along a small creek. On the sand bank, we saw a group of these magnificent butterflies known as Eastern Tiger Swallowtails. I estimated that there were around a dozen of these beautiful creatures. However, despite the beauty of these, they were in the act of what scientist call, mud-puddling. This is where large groups of mostly male butterflies will assemble aground smelly mud, animal urine, or dung. One observation that has been made is, while these butterflies drink from the mud/sand, liquid is pumped from their abdomens. You can see this in the last picture (a small droplet formed at the very tip of the abdomen). This was a mystifying experience even though I may have been laying in animal excretions in order to get these pictures!","43138, Logan, OH, US",39.4659503601,-82.4884364233,"","Eastern Tiger Swallowtail","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7586676","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/9910798/medium.jpg?1503329129","laurasimon",7586676,"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail","Insecta",60551,"false",1,0,"Sun Jul 30 2017 16:02:07 GMT-0400 (EDT)","2017-07-30","2017-07-30 13:02:07 -0700","Eastern Time (US & Canada)",1490,"","","false","","","false",594902,"2017-08-21 08:24:34 -0700","2017-08-21 08:31:58 -0700","research","",3,"false"

"Papilio glaucus","2017-04-16 20:04:00 -0500","Day 3 of City Nature Challenge (Easter)…  Today I decided to just go solo into the Fort Worth Nature Center.  I sure had a nice time going to some places I hadn’t been before.  I wasn’t able to stay out all day (family stuff this evening), but I did see quite a few things I hadn’t seen before.  

Will work on all of these ID’s later on – just wanted to upload them first.

Locations approximate for each observation (normally I try to get a little more specific, but I was all over the place on these days!).

This one was huge and he would fly around for a bit then after a while land at this spot to drink. This was a very interesting photo that I took after school today. Today has just been one surprise after another. This Swallowtail had black on the tops of his wings and on the outline of the side of the wings. He had dark stripes going downward on the upper wing. It was absolutely absolutely beautiful and amazing. This thing was huge. This is by far one of my favorite butterfly species. Mainly they are just a black and yellow butterfly. This is another early bird insect to come out this winter. This weird weather we have been having has really brought an interesting bunch of insects to come out an play. It is very weird. We are still in the middle of winter right? I am so confused.

We had the unexpected experience of having not one but two Eastern Tiger Swallowtails appear almost simultaneously by the side of the trail, with one being the dark morph of the species and the other the light form. The dark morph appeared first, followed immediately by the appearance of its alter ego, the light-colored form of the species. And they perched with their wings fully extended under the canopied setting. We provide observations of each one separately. The dark morph did not remain long though, and before we could pull out the second camera that had a flash to take its pic with, it had effortlessly flitted off into the denser portion of the wooded area. The canopy was formed by a dense stand of Cedar Elm and it is this tree's lower branches that the two tigers respectively chose to perch on. The light form Eastern Tiger Swallowtail stayed a bit longer and we were able to take its pic using both cameras including the one with the flash. And thus we present one pic each of it with and without the flash; the look and feel of the respective images is distinct but evocative just the same.

23 July 2016
Greenbelt Park 428
Denton County, Texas

We had the unexpected experience of having not one but two Eastern Tiger Swallowtails appear almost simultaneously by the side of the trail, with one being the dark morph of the species and the other the light form. The dark morph appeared first, followed immediately by the appearance of its alter ego, the light-colored form of the species. And they perched with their wings fully extended under the canopied setting. We provide observations of each one separately. The dark morph did not remain long though, and before we could pull out the second camera that had a flash to take its pic with, it had effortlessly flitted off into the denser portion of the wooded area. The canopy was formed by a dense stand of Cedar Elm and it is this tree's lower branches that the two tigers respectively favored. The light form Eastern Tiger Swallowtail stayed a bit longer and we were able to take its pic using both cameras including the one with the flash. And thus we present one pic each of it with and without the flash; the look of the images is distinct but evocative just the same.

Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) - male

2 September 2015: On a late afternoon hike through the once again accessible Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center (CCNHC) in Denton, Texas, we came upon a Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) full of blooms and butterflies. There were several other Buttonbushes on the edge of the wetlands lake at the CCNHC but this one had attracted a bounty of butterflies including Queens, Monarchs, Pipevine Swallowtails, male and female Eastern Tiger Swallowtails (Papilio glaucus), and an assortment of bees and wasps. The Eastern Tiger Swallowtails were the most amenable to having their digital images taken and the images in this observation represent those of a dark morph female that was taking nectar at this large Bottonbush which had the semblance of being a tree. The historic rains of the spring of 2015 (and of May 2015 in particular) appear to be behind us now and the trails are passable though the clearing of all the downed trees and washed out parts of the various trails remains to be done. The work appears to be advancing though and as things stand currently no obstacle is too great to impede one’s passage. Because there’s been no rain since the middle of June in the area the ground once wet is now dried and cracked, broken into countless pieces like a giant jigsaw puzzle. Several species of dragonflies were flying in the immediate area next to the butterflies and all along the Wetlands Trail adjoining the wetlands lake including Widow Skimmers, Common Whitetails, Eastern Pondhawks, Blue Dashers and Variegated Meadowhawks. Among the damselflies the most numerous were the Orange Bluets which were making the most of the late afternoon sun to lay their precious eggs along the shore of the seasonally changing wetlands lake. The wetlands lake at the CCNHC is currently filled to capacity and its shoreline is but a few feet distant from the trails. We were glad to have had our second encounter in as many weeks with the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail. A week ago we posted our observation of a large male Eastern Tiger Swallowtail. Today we present a more worn male than the one we observed last week. We enjoyed our hike and in the course of the three-mile course we encountered only one other person who was out making the trek. The CCNHC is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.

Note: What we refer to as the Wetlands Trail in our note above is referred to as the Rookery Trail and Duck Trail in the Google map used by iNat.

26 August 2015: Walked the hard rock creek bed of Cooper Creek for a distance from Avondale Park downstream nearly a half mile and examined the remaining water holes. No rain in the near-term forecast. Most of the Bluegill, Western Mosquitofish, Black Bullhead, and other species that inhabit the creek are nearly entirely gone due to the predation of the big aquatic birds (Yellow-crowned Night Heron, Snowy Egret, Great White Egret, and Cattle Egret) who have been frequenting the creek’s fast-disappearing water holes and leaving fewer fish each day that passes in what remains of the water. For the big birds it’s a time of plenty, for the fish this is the end of the line. They shall fly as big birds in their next lives. It’s the circle of life. We are reminded that these are ancient human beliefs that get recycled and repackaged for each succeeding generation. To a greater or lesser degree, this is the crisis of Cooper Creek every late summer in August and the start of September, when the rains will most likely finally come. It’s the start of the hurricane season and reports in the media indicate that the Gulf of Mexico’s first hurricane is barreling across a portion of the Caribbean and may even touch a portion of the Florida peninsula by Monday at the latest. But on Cooper Creek even the turtles have left. Perhaps they walked to find places with greater levels of water (things that only turtles know) or have dug themselves into the soft mud banks of the creek to await the rains and are hunkered down with their nose to the wind anticipating the precious liquid.

On our return walk after having surveyed this scene we encountered this magnificently large male Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) flying over the creek bed. It was looking to perch first on one side and then the next and eventually stopped numerous times on different branches of the predominant shrubs found on the creek’s banks. It allowed us plenty of time to take some digital images (presented above). We left it perched on the side of the creek content to have had our walk generously recognized in this way by this wandering winged lord of the skies. More frequent are the times when they will not stop for you or anyone or anything headed somewhere else far more important and filled with purpose or so it would seem. And then as if this was the appointed day and the appointed hour, there it is, and there you are, and yes, this is the time to commune, to artfully dance and mutually recognize one another. And so it was today during the late afternoon while elsewhere on Cooper Creek and Avondale Park the Dusky Dancers were busy procreating and appeared in force at several of the creek’s remaining water holes depositing their eggs on submerged leaf matter as if there was no tomorrow. But we will post their image and story soon enough in another separate observation. So once again we had an encounter with a butterfly: a large swallowtail, the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail. And it was a good thing. It always is. Cooper Creek and Avondale Park are administered by the City of Denton, Texas.

The Eastern Tiger Swallowtail is a North American butterfly. It occurs mostly in the eastern half of the United States and the North Texas region is located at a point of its westernmost range in this respect. Its range extends northward into the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada.  Because of its North American presence one can certainly consider the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere.
