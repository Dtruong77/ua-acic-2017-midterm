"Celastrina neglectamajor","2016-06-15 13:52:00 -0400","At Warriors Path State Park in Bedford County, I found a colony of azure caterpillars on black cohosh flowerbud spikes. The spider in the 4th shot was going after the ant, not the caterpillar, but my proximity scared it off. 
There were azure caterpillars of several sizes and colors. There were 0 to 2 ants per caterpillar, and each ant stayed busy around a caterpillar without leaving. The solid purple caterpillar kept everting two little organs with star-like tips. It generally did this when its ant was near, and it pulled them in when the ant got too close. I am not sure if these are sensory organs, or if they are producing a scent to influence or communicate to the ant.

The 1st instar cat here is green - does this make it a summer azure? Are the larger ones Appalachians?","Pennsylvania, US",40.1581018349,-78.2453665724,NA,"Appalachian Azure","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/4312429","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/5181472/medium.jpeg?1476113796","pete_woods",4312429,"Appalachian Azure","Insecta",82793,"false",1,0,"2016/06/15 1:52 PM EDT","2016-06-15","2016-06-15 10:52:00 -0700","Eastern Time (US & Canada)",93,"Warriors Path State Park, Liberty, PA, US",NA,"true",NA,NA,NA,2470,"2016-10-10 08:40:42 -0700","2017-05-19 21:02:35 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
