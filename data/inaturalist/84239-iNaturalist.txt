An amazing butterfly day!

Going for a morning hike along the Kaibob Trail as it passes through the Saddle Mountain Wilderness along the east Rim of the Grand Canyon, there was a field of these yellow Asteraceae and a greater diversity of butterflies than I had ever seen in my life. There were at least a dozen species and hundreds of individuals. The birding trip quickly morphed into a butterfly photography trip. I tried to photograph all of the species I saw, but several including at least one large fritillary and a swallowtail eluded me.
