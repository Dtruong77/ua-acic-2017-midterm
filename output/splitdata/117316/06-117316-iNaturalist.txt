"Colias behrii","2015-06-29 12:13:00 -0700","Atop a Sierra Daisy (Erigeron algidus), a Sierra Sulphur sat nectaring just long enough to allow me one good photograph.

It is the only greenish-tinted Sulphur in its range, and its soothing pink fringe indicates the individual is female.

This Sierra Nevada endemic visited me in the Tablelands of Sequoia-King's Canyon Wilderness, at an unnamed glacial lake of 10,560' elevation, just above the Table Meadows and approximately 2.5 miles due west of Big Bird Lake. Scattered cumulus clouds cast intermittent partial shade; ambient temperature was approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Much of the vegetation of the area consistent with wet and moist meadows, although that moisture is fleeting, and there was a fair but not abundant local supply of Dwarf Bilberry (Vaccinium caespitosum), its larval foodsource. This is the only individual of the species I positively identified during a week long camp in the area.","Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, US-CA, US",36.6250889447,-118.6774014575,"Sierra, Sulphur, Colias, behrii","Sierra Sulphur","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2334567","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/2590700/medium.jpg?1446268870","olbugs",2334567,"Sierra Green Sulfur","Insecta",117316,"false",1,0,"2015-06-29 12:13:00","2015-06-29","2015-06-29 12:13:00 -0700","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",50,"Tablelands, Sierra Nevada, California",NA,"true",NA,NA,NA,142119,"2015-10-30 22:21:02 -0700","2017-07-13 21:36:02 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
