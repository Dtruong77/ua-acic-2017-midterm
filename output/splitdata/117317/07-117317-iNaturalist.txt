Elev. about 50 feet, doug firs and a few planted redwoods are the dominant canopy, with alders, large coast live oaks, bays, and some plum trees along the streams and yards. Female dogface stopped to take nectar at some planted penstemons - about 4 or 5 minutes, then she left.  This is the only  dogface I've seen in my yard in almost 9 years.
