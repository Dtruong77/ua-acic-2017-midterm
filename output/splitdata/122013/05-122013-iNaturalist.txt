"Udara blackburni","2016-05-25 09:43:32 -1000","Save the Best for Last today - @sea-kangaroo and myself guided into Kameamea Lady habitat by folks working on the genetics of this elusive butterfly. Only one of two endemics to the Islands. Will put out mashed banana bait to lure them in. Warm sun turned to torrential rains. Didn't see the Vanessa, BUT saw the other endemic. The Greenish Bluet or Blackburn's Blue. A blue butterfly that is green. Read about this creature for decades. Insane thrill to finally see it.  This is the only shot I managed to take of it. It'll do. :)","96792, Waianae, HI, US",21.4944633333,-158.1573028333,NA,"Hawaiian Blue","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3305121","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/3819917/medium.jpg?1464253227","robberfly",3305121,"Green Hawaiian Blue","Insecta",122013,"false",1,0,"Wed May 25 2016 09:43:32 GMT-1000 (HST)","2016-05-25","2016-05-25 12:43:32 -0700","Hawaii",NA,NA,NA,"false",NA,"",NA,13979,"2016-05-26 01:59:17 -0700","2016-05-26 20:18:59 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",3,"false"
