This one has a flame red band on its lower part of the wing and is a greenish color. I had an interesting looking front and head section. This guy was proving to be a challenge to photograph. The closer I got the farther it would get. I finally had the perfect angle to where I would get the full butterfly in this preferred shot. This thing was sure stripy on his antenna and his legs. These things are pretty cool and a bit of a switch up from my other observations of Hairstreaks. I am very thrilled to add this one to the old life list. ","Elmer W.
