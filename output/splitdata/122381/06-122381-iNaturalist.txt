Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland
Cottonwood Lake
County Road 2560 & 900 Forest Service Road
Wise County, Texas

Eastern Tailed Blue was taking in minerals and moisture next to the lake's shore.  The Cottonwood Lake area is not one that provides basic amenities like a restroom and potable water. There are no trash cans either. Instead signs indicate that if you pack it in, you have to pack it out. The lake was filled to capacity and evidence indicated recent flooding in the lake's adjoining area. The LBJ National Grassland is administered by the US Forest Service, US Department of Agriculture.","Cottonwood Lake, Lyndon B.
