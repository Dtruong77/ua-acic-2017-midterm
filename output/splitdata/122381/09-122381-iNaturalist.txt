"Cupido comyntas","2016-09-05 00:15:54 -0400","Letchworth State Park is full of different plants and animals. This insect was seen flying around in an open area as I was walking the trail. The area was sunny, not covered by many trees, but heavy with vegetation which was close to the ground. Most of the vegetation seemed to be very green and alive.  However, I noticed there were few, but not many flowers. I only noticed one insect like this, but several other different types flying around. The wing span was about 2 inches in diameter and was smaller compared to the other similar insects in the area. The insect did not seem to be afraid of us and went about what it was doing. I noticed the color had a white, bluish tint and this sort of made it blend into the surrounding environment in an attempt to help camouflage. It also had small black spots and an orange spot towards the end of the wings, and a white ring around the outside of the wings.

Note: For the record we should mention that according to the Wikipedia entry this butterfly species is identified by both its given scientific names, Everes comyntas and Cupido comyntas. iNat uses the latter and therefore so do we. A quick online check will readily produce both given names.

21 September 2015: We walked about the Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center (CCNHC), in Denton, Texas today and came upon several small butterflies flying in and around a patch of wildflowers on the Wetlands Trail. We had not documented this small butterfly before (its wingspan is between three-quarters of an inch to one inch in width) and we subsequently determined that these were Eastern Tailed Blue (Everes comyntas or Cupido comyntas). This butterfly is found throughout North America but primarily in the eastern half of the United States with scattered western populations (according to the Gardens with Wings range map) in northern and coastal California and Oregon as well as the easternmost part of Washington and the panhandle of Idaho up to the Canadian border. There’s very little reach into Canada by this particular butterfly apparently with the major exception being the southernmost parts of the Canadian provinces touching on the Great Lakes. If these are its northern, eastern and western reaches, its southern extension is found in Mexico. By way of getting to Mexico pockets of Eastern Tailed Blue also fly in southeastern Arizona and New Mexico and the westernmost tip of Texas including El Paso and Chihuahua on the other side of the international border where this butterfly flies extensively in the mountains and plains of the Chihuahua desert.  Similarly, Eastern Tailed Blue flies through most of Texas except for the western parts of the state and the Panhandle with the noted exceptions. In Mexico, Eastern Tailed Blue surely flies in Coahuila and Tamaulipas across the international divide from Texas and is found on the Pacific Coast by way of Chihuahua to Sinaloa and Jalisco. Its range according to the range map in Gardens with Wings does not have Eastern Tailed Blue flying in most of Mexico except for those places that have already been indicated. Because it flies the skies over North America and has long been doing so, there’s no question but that Eastern Tailed Blue is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere.
