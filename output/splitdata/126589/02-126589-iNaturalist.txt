I have left this one at the genus level, because it shows characteristics of both the Red-banded Hairstreak and Dusky-blue Groundstreak.
The red band on the upper portion of the hind wing looks thicker than Dusky-blue Groundstreak, but the thinner line on the forewing doesn't look thick enough for Red-banded Hairstreak.  The leading edge of the forewing looks redder than Dusky-blue.
