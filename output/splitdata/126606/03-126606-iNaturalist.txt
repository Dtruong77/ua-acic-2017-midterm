"Panoquina panoquin","2012-03-31 00:00:00 -0500","This little skipper was fluttering about the southern end of L. Pond road near Marsh Bay Creek at Merritt Island. I've seen many over the years, but rarely get decent photographs for one reason or another.

Thanks to cyric for helping tag the formal identification!
