"Callophrys henrici","2016-03-13 00:00:00 -0600","I have a blooming Redbud tree in my yard. I was doing a little weeding around the base of the tree a while ago and I noticed a couple of Juniper Hairstreaks visiting the redbud blooms. Nice, but a species I see in my yard fairly often, so I went back to weeding. Then I thought I saw a browner small hairstreak and got a naked eye look at a Henry's Elfin on the redbud (which is one of the food plants for the species). Henry's is an uncommon early season hairstreak locally, but I had never seen one in this immediate area before. I went inside and got some camera gear and came back out and eventually found about 4 Henry's Elfins in my redbud. It was fairly windy so a bit of a challenge to get shots since the limbs of the tree were whipping all over the place, but with my wife trying to hold a limb from moving so much I did get a few shots. So, a fun new critter for my yard and a species which is somewhat uncommon and local in this area. If I get a day soon with less wind perhaps I can get some other shots. I have checked this redbud for Henry's in previous years without success. This is the first iNat record of the species for Hays Co., Texas, but it is documented from this county elsewhere I'm sure.

Note: The redbud I have is a nursury-purchased Redbud (Cercis canadensis), so it may or may not be Texas Redbud (Cercis canadensis ssp. texensis).
