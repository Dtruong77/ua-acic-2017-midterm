"Achalarus lyciades","2017-04-16 07:52:00 -0500","Day 3 of City Nature Challenge (Easter)…  Today I decided to just go solo into the Fort Worth Nature Center.  I sure had a nice time going to some places I hadn’t been before.  I wasn’t able to stay out all day (family stuff this evening), but I did see quite a few things I hadn’t seen before.  

Will work on all of these ID’s later on – just wanted to upload them first.

Locations approximate for each observation (normally I try to get a little more specific, but I was all over the place on these days!).
