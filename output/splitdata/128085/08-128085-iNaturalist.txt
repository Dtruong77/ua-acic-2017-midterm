"Achalarus casica","2017-08-24 00:00:00 -0600","The rest of the day was spent around Pena Blanca Lake. Most of us just went out solo to explore on our own and came back at night to set up the black lights. Lots of amazing stuff here!

Still working on the ID's for these...

Check out the journal entry for lots of better photos of many of these same species:
