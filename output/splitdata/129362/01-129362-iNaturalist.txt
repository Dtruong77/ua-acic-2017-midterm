Bill Dodd, Chuck Sexton, and I wanted to find a patch of Beard Lichen (Usnea trichodea) that Bill and I had originally found in April 2015 during a Golden-cheeked Warbler survey. Chuck thought this might have been the same patch he had found 20 years earlier. We found the patch, but Chuck didn't think it was the same one he had found. His patch was on a ridge. We searched the gorge just south of this patch and while we didn't find the Beard Lichen, we did find some beautiful springs.","Austin, TX, USA",30.29393,-97.903,"BartonCreekHabitatPreserve, Texas, Wildlife, austin, butterfly, insect, mikael_behrens","Southern Dogface","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5001514","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/6114015/medium.jpg?1485302704","mikaelb",5001514,"Southern Dogface","Insecta",129362,"false",3,0,"2017/01/22 11:03 AM CST","2017-01-22","2017-01-22 10:03:00 -0700","Central Time (US & Canada)",5,"","","false","","",NA,9685,"2017-01-24 17:09:38 -0700","2017-01-24 21:47:44 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
