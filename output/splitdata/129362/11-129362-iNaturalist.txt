@dhend9 @ericisley and I went to Bastrop County today and met up with @ncowey at McKinney Roughs Nature Park where Nick works. 
http://www.lcra.org/parks/developed-parks/Pages/mckinney-roughs-nature-park.aspx
The park is owned and managed by the L.C.R.A. (Lower Colorado River Authority). Nick was very gracious and gave us a good tour of the park and we found a bunch of things to iNat as well as a new odonate or two for the park.
