* This is the first iNat record of Orange Skipperling for Denton County, Texas: https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=1862&taxon_id=129415

Our observation found Orange Skipperling (female) nectaring on Common Vetch. Orange Skipperling is found in six southwestern states within the United States including (in alphabetical order): Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. Its range extends from its indicated US range south through Mexico and on into Central America all the way to Panama. It apparently does not extend its range into South America. With respect to its taxonomy, The Butterflies of the World Foundation states: ""The family Hesperiidae includes all butterflies that are collectively called skippers because of their fast skipping flight.  This family is the sole member of the Superfamily Hesperioidea.  Whereas, the other five families of butterflies belong to the Superfamily Papilionoidea.  So, skippers are considered butterflies, but they have a few traits different than the species of “True” butterflies found in the Superfamily Papilionoidea.  Some of these traits include large eyes, short antennae (often with hooked clubs) and stout bodies.  Most also have a very rapid flight with a fast, almost blurred, wing beat.  There are about 3,500 species of skippers and they’re further divided into seven subfamilies.  They occur worldwide with more found in the tropics. Most species are brown or tan, but some tropical members can be quite colorful."" Because of its presence in North and Central America, Orange Skipperling is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. CCNHC is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.
