"Phoebis philea","2016-11-10 12:44:00 -0600","After 4 days of drizzle and rain it dried up today and we got a little sun. butterflies came out in fair numbers for a change. I have not seen many Orange-barred Sulphurs, but I believe I have the ID correct. I watched as 3 very large sulphurs starting visiting my shrimp plants and noted the dorsal side of the wings was yellow but that the dorsal side of the hind wings was strongly and obviously diffused with bright orange. This was almost impossible to photograph as the sulphurs kept the wings closed when feeding, but there is a blurry shot (image 2) of one taking off which shows the dorsal wing surface pretty well. Also, image 3 shows the yellow edge of the dorsal area of a wing while a damaged area in the hind wing will show the orange area peeking though. From field guides I suspect all three of the individuals I saw were females. This is a species I’ve only seen in south Texas near the Mexico border in the past, but I do know that they occur occasionally in the Austin region. New for my yard for sure.
