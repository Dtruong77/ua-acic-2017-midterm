I sure had a nice time going to some places I hadn’t been before.  I wasn’t able to stay out all day (family stuff this evening), but I did see quite a few things I hadn’t seen before.  

Will work on all of these ID’s later on – just wanted to upload them first.

Locations approximate for each observation (normally I try to get a little more specific, but I was all over the place on these days!).
