The Clouded Skipper we observed at TWU was feeding on Texas Lantana, which is one of its host plants. Clouded Skipper ranges far and wide in both North and South America. In North America its outer northern range occurs in the vicinity of the Great Lakes including states like Illinois and Ohio thence east to the Atlantic Coast encompassing states like West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland. It does not extend north of this line of states in the United States apparently (according to the BugGuide data or range map) but occurs south of these states to Florida and west to Texas and Arizona. It doesn’t appear to occur in Canada. But its range extends far toward the south passing through Mexico, Central America and into South America where its southern range extends as far as Colombia and Venezuela at the northwestern end of the continent. Because of its extensive range north and south, Clouded Skipper is clearly an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere.
