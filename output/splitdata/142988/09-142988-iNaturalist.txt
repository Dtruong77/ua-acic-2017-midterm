26 September 2014: Not 100 yards from our backdoor on Cooper Creek and adjoining Avondale Park in Denton, Texas we came upon a male Clouded Skipper (Lerema accius) that was taking in the sun and moisture available at the site. The range of the Clouded Skipper is from the “southeastern United States to northern South America. It is occasional up through coastal New England and from there flies inland to Indiana and Missouri,” to paraphrase the short description found at BugGuide. At the Dallas County Lepidopterists’ Society, they note that Clouded Skipper flies throughout the North Texas metropolitan area from March through December. Here’s the classification for Clouded Skipper presented at BugGuide:

Classification 
Kingdom Animalia (Animals) 
Phylum Arthropoda (Arthropods) 
Subphylum Hexapoda (Hexapods) 
Class Insecta (Insects) 
Order Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths) 
Superfamily Hesperioidea (Skippers) 
Family Hesperiidae (Skippers) 
Subfamily Hesperiinae (Grass Skippers) 
Genus Lerema 
Species accius (Clouded Skipper)
