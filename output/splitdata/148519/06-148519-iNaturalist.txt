"Pyrgus philetas","2017-06-10 16:28:00 -0500","I generally don't feel confident about these checkered skippers. I don't even try if I think it belongs to Pyrgus communis or P. albescens. However, I think this has enough distinction to place it in P. philetas. 1) the little rectangular white spot near the center of the leading edge of the forewing is accompanied by a ""nice-sized"" roundish white dot, 2) the white dots along the outer edge of the forewing extend along the entire edge (not fading away), 3) light, relatively un-patterned ventral surface of hindwing, with two dark spots along the leading edge. I look forward to constructive feedback.
