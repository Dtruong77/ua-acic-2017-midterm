It has *most* of the field marks of Tropical, vis.: large white spot beyond cell bar, marginal white dot at FW apex, and relatively large marginal white dots on HW, but it doesn't show the characteristic darker fringe on the FW.  So I'll take 3/4 of the field marks to make this P. oileus and write off the fringe as an aberration.
