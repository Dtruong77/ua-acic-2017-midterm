This was a fun encounter with this species as I had seen it several times in the past but had never managed to photograph it before. I found 10 or 12 Texas Powdered Skippers along a hundred yard area of Max Starke Dam Road. I'll post several shots...a really jazzy looking skipper.","near Max Starke Dam, Marble Falls, Texas",30.5535,-98.2601,"","Texas Powdered Skipper","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/903320","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/1150903/medium.jpg?1412104507","greglasley",903320,"Texas Powdered Skipper","Insecta",148522,"false",2,0,"2014-09-30","2014-09-30","","Central Time (US & Canada)",25,"","","false","","",NA,9706,"2014-09-30 12:14:38 -0700","2017-09-25 14:51:10 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
