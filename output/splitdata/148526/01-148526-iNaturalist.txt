We also got good looks at a jazzy Blue-and-white Heliconian nearby (Heliconius sapho): http://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/258079-Heliconius-sapho","Bonampak Zona Arqueol√≥gica, Chis., Mexico",16.7044988956,-91.0643541813,"Butterfly, Lepidoptera, Mexico","Hoary Skipper","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5004173","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/6117661/medium.jpg?1485354788","gcwarbler",5004173,"Carrhenes canescens","Insecta",148526,"false",1,0,"2017/01/10 12:56 PM CST","2017-01-10","2017-01-10 11:56:00 -0700","Central Time (US & Canada)",100,NA,NA,"false","","",NA,27047,"2017-01-25 07:43:55 -0700","2017-03-08 13:20:27 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
