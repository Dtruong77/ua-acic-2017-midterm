"Staphylus mazans","2016-05-25 00:00:00 -0600","This one was a bit of a head scratcher. When I saw it I thought Mazans Scallopwing, but the more I looked at the photo the more uncertain I became. The hindwings are not really obviously scalloped and it lead me to think that It could be a Sootywing, but that darker pm band on the hindwing is not seen in sootywings, the head is not white enough, and the sootywings I'm used to seeing down here seem to have more white spotting, though that could be variable. Anyways, this is a skipper I'm not used to seeing much in the gardens. I think this is my first photo record of one here.","Edinburg Scenic Wetlands",26.291567,-98.134591,"","Mazans Scallopwing","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3308960","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/3824288/medium.JPG?1464293845","javigonz",3308960,"Mazans Scallopwing","Insecta",148528,"false",1,0,"2016-05-25","2016-05-25","","Central Time (US & Canada)",7,"","","false","","",NA,94135,"2016-05-26 13:17:21 -0700","2017-09-26 03:41:20 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
