This species is found in the US only in a very restricted band along the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, although it is listed as common in appropriate habitat there -- namely, riparian sycamore woods,  which is exactly where I found it.  Got a good look thru binocs -- hindwing above bright orange with concentric dark banding, forewing above with dark shading along the central part of the median line.  Unfortunately it didn't let me get a shot -- only one I got was a zoom macro with it perched far above our heads in a tree.","Mcguireville, Arizona, United States",34.611683,-111.842236,"","Zela Metalmark","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/514432","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/655172/medium.jpg?1444428771","anita363",514432,"Zela Metalmark","Insecta",193851,"false",1,0,"2009-03-17 16:49:09","2009-03-17","2009-03-17 13:49:09 -0700","Eastern Time (US & Canada)",NA,"","","false","","",NA,3773,"2014-01-28 18:27:11 -0700","2017-01-16 22:24:44 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC-SA",NA,"false"
