Lifer for me! Notice the dark spot within the zig zag on the hindwing, unlike the red of a Dusky-blue Groundstreak. In the first photo you can see a flash of orange from its dorsal side. It was visible briefly as the hairstreak rubbed its hindwings.","Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge",26.082106,-98.135253,"","Ruddy Hairstreak","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3343922","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/3861563/medium.JPG?1464655781","javigonz",3343922,"Ruddy Hairstreak","Insecta",204641,"false",2,0,"2016-05-30","2016-05-30","","Central Time (US & Canada)",29,NA,NA,"false",NA,"",NA,94135,"2016-05-30 17:49:39 -0700","2017-09-26 03:51:30 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
