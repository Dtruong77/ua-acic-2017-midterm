"Megathymus yuccae","2015-04-01 00:00:00 -0600","Walking along a dirt road in pine forest with grassland component when John Abbott spotted this adult giant-skipper. This was the first of this species I have ever photographed. This is the only giant-skipper species which occurs in this area of Texas. We did find some yuccas nearby and I'll post a shot of the plant as well. I have a number of images of this individual, but all similar to this. After allowing our group of 5 a minute for photos, the critter took off like a bullet.

I posted a record of the yucca at:
