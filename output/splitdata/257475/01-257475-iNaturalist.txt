"Cymaenes trebius","2017-01-11 00:00:00 -0600","Was down in the Lower Rio Grande Valley for a staff meeting with the other urban wildlife biologists.  Had such a great time -- temps in the 80's!  This day was the field-trip day, and Tony chose some awesome places to explore.  

We then went to the Hugh Ramsey Nature Park in Harlingen -- this was an AWESOME park maintained by the master naturalists.  Would have loved to spend some more time here, but we had a stop to get to before sunset.","Hugh Ramsey Nature Park, Harlingen, Texas",26.186792,-97.663446,"","Fawn-spotted Skipper","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/4941204","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/6025632/medium.jpeg?1484376620","sambiology",4941204,"Fawn-spotted Skipper","Insecta",257475,"false",1,0,"2017-01-11","2017-01-11","","Central Time (US & Canada)",3,NA,NA,"false","","",NA,22589,"2017-01-13 23:50:18 -0700","2017-06-20 22:11:51 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
