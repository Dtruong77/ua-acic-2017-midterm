"Strymon bebrycia","2015-01-22 00:00:00 -0600","Thanks to Andrew Warren for ID. Dorsal view suggestive of S. bebrycia, but had also wondered about possibility of S. yojoa. Ventral view (seen to small extent in second picture of individual in flight) is diagnostic, ruling out S. yojoa and confirming S. bebrycia.
