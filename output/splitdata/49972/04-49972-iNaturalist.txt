Battus philenor, the pipevine swallowtail or blue swallowtail,[1][2] is a swallowtail butterfly found in North America and Central America. The butterflies are black with iridescent-blue hindwings. They are found in many different habitats, but are most commonly found in forests.[3] The black or red caterpillars feed on Aristolochia species, making them poisonous as both larvae and adults, while the adults feed on the nectar of a variety of flowers.

The upper surface of the hindwings are an iridescent blue or blue green with pale, arrowhead markings. Males have brighter metallic regions than females.[4] The underside of the hindwing has seven orange submarginal spots surrounded by iridescent blue.[5] Both surfaces of the forewings are black or dull blackish brown.[4][6] Individuals of the Northern California subspecies, Battus philenor hirsuta, are smaller and hairier.[7] Pipevine swallowtails can have a wingspan to up to  3 1⁄2 inches (89 mm). Battus philenor can usually be found in fields, meadows, gardens, parks, open woods, roadsides and stream sides.

Greenbelt Corridor Ray Roberts Lake/Lewisville Lake FM 428 Access Area, Aubrey Branch
Denton County, Texas

Numerous Pipevine Swallowtails were observed but for the most part they were not stopping and those that did stop (to nectar on the blooming Texas Paintbrush) were avoiding anyone getting too close before flying off to better haunts. We did manage this one from a distance of about 20 feet or more and thus the grainy images. The FM 428 Access Area of the Greenbelt Corridor is administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.","Greenbelt Corridor Ray Roberts Lake/Lewisville Lake FM 428 Access Area, Aubrey Branch, Denton County, Texas",33.300848,-97.04185,"Pipevine Swallowtail (Battus philenor), Greenbelt Corridor Ray Roberts Lake/Lewisville Lake FM 428 Access Area, Aubrey Branch, Denton County, Texas, swallowtails, butterflies, spring, North Texas, North America, Western Hemisphere, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department","Pipevine Swallowtail","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2883614","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/3294739/medium.jpg?1459837328","aguilita",2883614,"Pipevine Swallowtail","Insecta",49972,"false",3,0,"2016-04-02","2016-04-02","","Central Time (US & Canada)",301,"","","false","","",NA,115129,"2016-04-04 23:22:05 -0700","2017-09-26 01:11:22 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
