"Battus philenor","2016-09-21 00:04:00 -0500","This thing was absolutely beautiful. It is by far my favorite Swallowtail Butterfly in the US so far. This one is dark with blue coloration to its wings. One the side of the body it had little yellow dots in a row near the Thorax. It was an absolutely beautiful insect. It was hard to photograph because when feeding these things flutter and don't stay in one place for long. These things are large butterflies. It was hard for me to judge the size due to the constant fluttering of the wings. It seemed to like the salvia plants at the pollinator garden.

"Battus philenor","2016-09-22 20:52:48 -0500","Battus is a New World genus of butterflies that are usually found around pipevine (genus Aristolochia) plants. The caterpillars feed off the poisonous pipevines, making the insects poisonous themselves; they taste very bad to ward off predators. Since birds avoid these butterflies, other swallowtail species mimic their coloration. The common North American species are Battus polydamas and Battus philenor.","Harris County, US-TX, US",29.8584682905,-95.1606170833,"","Pipevine Swallowtail","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/4178116","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/4976481/medium.jpeg?1474595650","rstewart",4178116,"Pipevine Swallowtail","Insecta",49972,"true",3,1,"2016-09-22 8:52:48 PM CDT","2016-09-22","2016-09-22 18:52:48 -0700","Central Time (US & Canada)",688,"","","false","gps","gps",NA,320833,"2016-09-22 18:54:02 -0700","2017-09-26 08:03:07 -0700","research","",2,"false"

2 September 2015: On a late afternoon hike through the once again accessible Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center (CCNHC) in Denton, Texas, we came upon a Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) full of blooms and butterflies. There were several other Buttonbushes on the edge of the wetlands lake at the CCNHC but this one had attracted a bounty of butterflies including Queens, Monarchs, male and female Eastern Tiger Swallowtails, Pipevine Swallowtails (Battus philenor), and an assortment of bees and wasps. The most difficult to photograph among these was the subject of our present observation, the Pipevine Swallowtail.  The images presented here are of a female Pipevine Swallowtail that was flitting about from one bloom to another at this large Bottonbush which had the semblance of being a tree. Our previous encounter with Pipevine Swallowtail was at the Elm Fork Park (between Pilot Point and Sanger, Texas) in the northernmost portion of Denton County. That happened in June, so it’d been awhile seen we’d had the opportunity to quickly snap a few of this dark swallowtail, one of the so-called four dark swallowtails. We enjoyed our hike and in the course of the three-mile course we encountered only one other person who was out making the trek. The CCNHC is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.

The range of Pipevine Swallowtail occurs strictly within the sphere of North America especially Mexico and the United States, according to the range map presented at the Gardens with Wings Web site for this butterfly species. The farthest western, northern and eastern range for Pipevine Swallowtail starts on the West Coast of the Baja California Peninsula and moves in a gentle northeasterly direction through the northern Mexican states and on into Arizona and New Mexico thence northeast from there through Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, southern New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island to the Atlantic Ocean. This line of states constitutes the range of this butterfly species at its farthest point in these various directions. In the case of Mexico, Pipevine Swallowtail occurs throughout the northern and central region of the country and includes all the states to the north of its southernmost range which is comprised of (west to east starting at the Pacific Ocean) Jalisco, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosí, and Tamaulipas to the Gulf of Mexico. Pipevine Swallowtail also enjoys a very peculiar but special range in northern California which ends about where its northern border meets with Oregon’s southern border. The entire state of Texas is in the flight path of Pipevine Swallowtail. 

Because of its extensive range across North America and especially Mexico and United States, Pipevine Swallowtail is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. 

Note: For the purposes of this observation please note that the Google map refers to what we call the Wetlands Trail as the Rookery Trail and Duck Trail.
