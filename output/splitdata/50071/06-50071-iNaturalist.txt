Greenbelt Corridor Ray Roberts/Lewisville Lake FM 428 Access Area, Aubrey Branch
Denton County, Texas

Horace's Duskywing flies in Texas from March through November (based on the BugGuide data map). The one presented in this observation is a male that's feeding on Arrowleaf Clover. In general, Horace's Duskywing's range in North America extends from Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico in the West of the United States, east to Texas and thence north and east all the way to Ontario, Canada, and Florida, respectively. Because of its flight in the Southwest of the US, it's most likely that Horace's Duskywing's flight includes parts of northern Mexico. Because of its extensive flight in North America, Horace's Duskywing is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department administers the Greenbelt Corridor FM 428 Access Area.
