Can't be 100% positive that this is the same giant swallowtail as in the previous observation.  i walked to the waterfall  and the to the spontaneous pond on escarpment...then headed back toward the pond   so maybe 40 minutes later   as i approached the previous location i observed this Giant swallowtail.   

Because there are two varieties that are very similar i felt this one needed to be by itself   unfortunately this one did not show me the outside of his wings


This giant swallowtail is difficult to differentiate between the eastern giant swallowtail and the western giant swallowtail

On one hand the black spot on the upper wing in the large yellow bar is consistent with the Eastern Giant Swallowtail. and the edge of the wing has a yellow half moon on the edge again consistent with the Eastern Giant Swallowtail.

On the other hand the with the number of yellow ""cells"" near the outer edge toward the bottom of the top wing is more consistent with that of the Western Giant Swallowtail and the markings on the back of the head are also more consistent with the Western Giant Swallowtail.

the lower wing also shows traits of both. and lacks the last yellow cell shown on both species. overall there are more traits of the eastern giant swallowtail than the western giant swallowtails so I will leave my ID as Eastern Giant Swallowtail for now.
