26 September 2014: September 2014 was a good month for finding and documenting new butterflies we'd not previously observed even if they were nearly just outside our door. One of these new finds was the Eastern Giant Swallowtail (Heraclides cresphontes) which we present in this observation. This particular species was divided into two species a few years ago and one of the publications that references what occurred in great detail is offered in our sources for anyone to access if they'd like. There is now a Western Giant Swallowtail (Heraclides rumiko) (west of the Rocky Mountains basically in the United States) and the Eastern Giant Swallowtail.  But in Central Texas both forms of this beautiful butterfly occur including hybrids between the one and the other. The essay we reference below provides the field marks to look for that distinguish one from the other and the Heraclides rumiko is also generally smaller in size overall than the Heraclides cresphontes. What's even better said in the essay is that as with Nature generally, all of the several field marks have to be used together in order to arrive at the most accurate identification since there are variations and exceptions galore. A three percent genetic or DNA difference exists currently between the two forms or newly declared species of Giant Swallowtail. Nature will not be contained, restrained, or repressed. Rather its irrepressible tendencies will find a way to best express what it determines is needed; it is nonjudgmental. And so it is with this beauty of a butterfly that we encountered perched on a tree limb on the banks of Cooper Creek next to Avondale Park at the start of the fall season.

Avondale Park is administered by the City of Denton, Texas, and so is Cooper Creek, which is a minor tributary to the Elm Fork Trinity River.
