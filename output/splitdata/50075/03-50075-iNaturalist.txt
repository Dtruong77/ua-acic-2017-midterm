Subspecies florida has The Nature Conservancy rank of T3 - Very rare or local throughout its range or found locally in a restricted range (21 to 100 occurrences). (Threatened throughout its range).
NCGR:
Management Needs: Prevent destruction of habitats with Coontie. Control of caterpillars on ornamental cycads is sometimes necessary. Reintroduce Coontie to the Florida Keys.","Florida, US",26.1780207938,-80.3924225458,"","Atala","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7246121","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/9360831/medium.jpg?1501252931","ladylovesplants",7246121,"Atala","Insecta",50075,"false",1,0,"2017/03/06 12:04 PM EST","2017-03-06","2017-03-06 10:04:00 -0700","Eastern Time (US & Canada)",NA,"Davie, FL, USA",NA,"true","","",NA,497017,"2017-07-28 07:44:16 -0700","2017-07-28 12:56:45 -0700","research","",NA,"false"
