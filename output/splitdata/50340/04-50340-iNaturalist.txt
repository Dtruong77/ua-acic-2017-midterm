For the ButterflySCAN project, I have been assigned a location to explore every two weeks. My site is called Solano Canyon and is located northwest of downtown Los Angeles. (I enjoy this activity so much that sometimes I go every week, or every week-and-a-half, rather than waiting the full two weeks.) During my outing I walk through the neighborhood looking for, and counting, the various butterflies that I encounter. I also try to get photos of the butterflies that I see. (This photo is one that I took recently.)

I also record my butterfly observations on the <a href=""http://e-butterfly.org/contents/?portal=ebutterfly"" rel=""nofollow"">e-Butterfly.org</a> website.","Solano Canyon, Los Angeles, California",34.07717,-118.234363,"Fiery Skipper, Hylephila phyleus, butterfly, e-Butterfly.org, ButterflySCAN, Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, NHMLA, nhm.org","Fiery Skipper","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1383845","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/1709984/medium.jpg?1444333627","mgronwold",1383845,"Fiery Skipper Butterfly","Insecta",50340,"true",1,0,"2015-04-09 16:20","2015-04-09","2015-04-09 16:20:00 -0700","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,"","","false","","",NA,48084,"2015-04-11 00:21:59 -0700","2017-10-13 03:05:35 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC-ND",NA,"false"
