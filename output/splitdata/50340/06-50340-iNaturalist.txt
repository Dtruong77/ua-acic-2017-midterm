Greenbelt Corridor Ray Roberts/Lewisville Lake FM 428 Access Area, Aubrey Branch
Denton County, Texas

Fiery Skipper is perhaps the most common or widely known of the Skipper butterflies in the United States. The one presented in this observation is that of a female, which had stopped to rest before it continued on its way. In Texas (per the BugGuide data map), Fiery Skipper flies from January through December. Fiery Skipper flies in most of the United States including in the Northwest from Oregon to Massachusetts in New England, and thence on into Ontario, Canada. It also flies throughout most of the Americas as its flight takes it through Mexico, Central America, and into South America as far south as Argentina. Fiery Skipper is one of the quintessential American butterflies, in the hemispheric sense of the word. Because of its extensive flight it goes without saying that Fiery Skipper is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. The Greenbelt Corridor FM 428 Access Area is administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
