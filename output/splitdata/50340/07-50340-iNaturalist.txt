Fiery Skipper (Hylephila phyleus)

2 July 2014: Walking the trail at North Lakes Park we came upon this mating pair of Fiery Skippers (Hylephila phyleus) in the tall reeds growing by the side of the (northside) lake at North Lakes Park in Denton, Texas. 

Fiery Skipper is a North American butterfly found in the United States and Mexico. In the US the Fiery Skipper may be found from California on the West Coast to southern New England on the East Coast and most of the continental US in between in one way or another experiences the presence of this small skipper including the southern reaches of the Great Lakes and states adjoining these. Fiery Skipper is found throughout the Southwest and ranges southward into the central Mexican states. On the Pacific Coast it reaches southward to Jalisco and thence eastward to the area of northern Veracruz or southern Tamaulipas reaching those states in between these two points. The south central and southernmost states of Mexico apparently are not included in the Fiery Skipper's range to the south. Because it is a skipper familiar to the peoples of both Mexico and United States Fiery Skipper is a bonafide resident of the Western Hemisphere.

North Lakes Park is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.
