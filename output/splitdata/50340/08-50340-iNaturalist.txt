"Hylephila phyleus","2016-08-01 00:00:00 -1000","Hylephila phyleus is a year-round resident in the far southern United States ranging south to Argentina and throughout the Antilles, and introduced to Hawaii in 1970. This species is migratory northward to Ontario and Prince Edward Island in the east, and to Oregon in the west (Scott 1986). Habitats are southern urban lawns and grassy places. Host plants are grasses of several species. Eggs are laid on and around the host plant singly. There are multiple flights all year in southern Florida and southern Texas (Scott 1986).","waldrons ledge",19.422222,-155.256944,"HAVOINTERP","Fiery Skipper","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3825647","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/4473745/medium.jpg?1470599430","rangermichael",3825647,"Fiery Skipper","Insecta",50340,"false",1,0,"2016-08-01","2016-08-01","","Hawaii",NA,"","","false","","",NA,288152,"2016-08-07 12:50:25 -0700","2016-08-07 18:39:18 -0700","research","",NA,"false"
