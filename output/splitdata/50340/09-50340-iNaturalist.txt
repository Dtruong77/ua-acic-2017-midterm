"Hylephila phyleus","2016-09-06 09:52:52 -0500","This is a Skipper which may look like a cross between a butterfly and a moth. It is in the same family of Leopdaptra. They are active during the time butterflies are out. They are small and compact and keep their winds up like butterflies. This guy was about an inch long and was vibrantly colored. It had a wealth of orange, yellow, and black colors. It was a beautiful specimen but was hard to spot in the flowerbed. It was very cooperative and let me get several photos of him. He was sitting very still on a leaf. I don't know if it was sick or dying but it didn't attempt to fly he did move a little but it was puzzling. He was in fact very beautiful. Skippers always seem to fascinate me. I like the way that are shaped. They seem to be nor of Butterfly or Moth but rather a mix of the two like I said earlier on this post.
