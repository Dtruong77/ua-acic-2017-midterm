28 October 2015: Walked the three-mile loop of trails at the Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center in Denton, Texas, and on the Wetlands Trail at several places found that Honey Bee and Skippers were busy nectaring at blooming white wildflower we have yet to ID. This male Fiery Skipper (Hylephila phyleus) was photographed on the Wetlands Trail. We want to acknowledge our colleagues at BugGuide nature4me and Dr. Cliff Ivy for confirming the IDentification of this particular specimen including its gender. The BugGuide ID can be accessed here: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1160329

The range map provided at BugGuide based on observations submitted by those who use this service and platform to report their observations indicates that Fiery Skipper flies in about two-thirds of the states in the United States and parts of central Canada. Because all of the states bordering with Mexico report Fiery Skipper we can deduce that Fiery Skipper flies in Mexico too but the extent of its range in Mexico and/or beyond to the south is undetermined. However, because it flies extensively in North America, Fiery Skipper is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.
