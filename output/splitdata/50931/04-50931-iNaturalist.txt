"Strymon melinus","2017-04-18 00:00:00 -0600","Last day of the City Nature Challenge.  This was the last sprint to the finish at Tandy Hills!  We had quite a few folks that showed up, including several kiddos.  I had fun catching bugs with them – it was a great finish to the city nature challenge.  :)

Will work on all of these ID’s later on – just wanted to upload them first.

Locations approximate for each observation (normally I try to get a little more specific, but I was all over the place on these days!).

I sure had a nice time going to some places I hadn’t been before.  I wasn’t able to stay out all day (family stuff this evening), but I did see quite a few things I hadn’t seen before.
