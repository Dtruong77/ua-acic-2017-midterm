"Strymon melinus","2017-05-14 00:00:00 -0600","Final day at the Pat Mayse WMA BioBlitz with good friends from throughout Texas. I joined about 20 folks at this Wildlife Management Area to document as much as possible, and it was fantastic. I did try to document a few things, but more important for me, I got to spend time with some of my favorite naturalists in the whole world. As I go through each of these, I smile. :)

In the morning, we went to the east side of the WMA next to the lake.  It was a great spot for birds, and I was even able to photograph a few!
