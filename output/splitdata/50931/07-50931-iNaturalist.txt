Going for a morning hike along the Kaibob Trail as it passes through the Saddle Mountain Wilderness along the east Rim of the Grand Canyon, there was a field of these yellow Asteraceae and a greater diversity of butterflies than I had ever seen in my life. There were at least a dozen species and hundreds of individuals. The birding trip quickly morphed into a butterfly photography trip. I tried to photograph all of the species I saw, but several including at least one large fritillary and a swallowtail eluded me.

It was sitting there waggling the long &quot;tails&quot;.  I read that this is a predator distraction technique (presumably to go along with the false &quot;eyes&quot; in front of the tail &quot;antennae&quot;).  They also have a habit of rubbing the wings up &amp; down against each other (the tailed-blues were doing that too).   They are tiny (wingspan ~2.5 cm).  

Straight out of the camera (except for cropping); not unsharp-masked.  I love unsharp-mask, but I fear I've been using it as a crutch too much -- it's not a substitute for getting the focus right in the 1st place!  (or getting the resolution you need.)  It of necessity introduces artifacts -- you can't create information out of thin air.  And if overused it gives a harsh, artificial look  (which is probably just another way of saying the same thing).

Summary: 
Hairstreak butterflies have antenna-like filaments and bright eyespots at the far corner of their wings.  When sitting around, they'll rub that far corner up and down (which I saw this one doing as I started to bother it), which draws the attention of jumping spiders, which are visual hunters that aim for the head.  In the tests they did through the link, hairstreak butterflies were able to escape being spidered 100% of the time, while other butterflies were not nearly as fortunate.  As a side-effect, they really often have spider damage to their back lure section.

So cool!
