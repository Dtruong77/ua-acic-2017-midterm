Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus)

7 August 2015: Observed a Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus) at the Lake Lewisville Environmental Learning Area (LLELA) in Lewisville, Texas. LLELA is administered jointly by the US Army Corps of Engineers, City of Lewisville, Texas, and the University of North Texas.  

The Gray Hairstreak butterfly ranges over North America. Its flies literally over the entire continental United States except for the farthest northern edges of the state of Maine in New England. And it also flies over more than half of Mexico from its northern states to its southcentral states. Only Mexico’s most southern and southeastern states are outside the range of the Gray Hairstreak. And Canada is visited by the Gray Hairstreak in three of its mid-central provinces in their southern areas adjoining the US states of Montana and North Dakota. These provinces include Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It is in fact one of the most widely distributed North American butterflies. The range of the Gray Hairstreak does not extend to the Caribbean or past the central states of Mexico into Central and South America.

Because of its inimitable presence in North America, in Mexico, United States, and Canada, the Gray Hairstreak is without question a genuine resident of the Western Hemisphere.

I thought it'd spin a cocoon, but instead it just sat unmoving on the underside of a bean for a couple of days before starting to turn grey yesterday.  Apparently its cocoon is just its own skin.
