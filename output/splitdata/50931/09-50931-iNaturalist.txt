"Strymon melinus","2017-09-02 10:42:00 -0700","Gray Hairstreak (Styrmon melinus), also known as the Common Hairstreak, discovered nectaring on the flowers of some Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) at Pescadero State Beach in coastal San Mateo County, CA.  Even without a shot of the dorsal view of the wings, one can tell that this is a Hairstreak from the following traits:  

(1)  The pearly gray underwings with the exceedingly long ""tails,"" which are most visible in Shot 4 of this series.
(2)   The dark postmedial line stretch across both the forewings and the hindwings, edged on one side by white and on the other side by bright orange. 
(3) The large, black eyespots at the anal angle for the hindwings, with the large orange markings enveloping them. 

No other butterfly in the San Francisco Bay Area has this combination of traits.  These traits distinguish the Gray Hairstreak from all other butterflies, inclduing all of the other hairstreaks and both the Eastern and Western Tailed Blues.","Pescadero State Beach, San Mateo County, CA",37.2661435162,-122.4127578735,"Achillea millefolium, Common Hairstreak, Gray Hairstreak, Pescadero State Beach, Styrmon melinus, Yarrow","Gray Hairstreak","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7783388","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/10228960/medium.jpg?1504558339","arnel",7783388,"Gray Hairstreak","Insecta",50931,"false",1,0,"2017/09/02 10:42 AM PDT","2017-09-02","2017-09-02 10:42:00 -0700","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",2,"","","false","","",NA,29323,"2017-09-04 13:53:05 -0700","2017-09-04 17:02:01 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"

Butterfly Magic
It looks like this butterfly is hanging upside-down on a blossom that is suspended mid air.  What you can't see is the single line of spider web by which the blossom is hanging.  I had no idea the photo would be like this until I saw it on my computer.  What are the odds.  The butterfly is a female gray hairstreak, you can tell by the fact that her abdomen is all gray with no orange.  She is tiny and apparently does not weight enough to knock the blossom off the thread of silk.  No photoshop or rotation here, just incredible luck on my part.

Just as I was focusing on the butterfly, waiting for it to turn around, this bug popped up over the top of the flowers and took a big bite of the petals.

"Strymon melinus","2016-09-21 11:30:00 -0500","These guys are one of my all time favorite butterflies. This is one of the smallest I have encountered. True on any given spring or summer day you can find these guys all around. However this one was spotted when I was volunteering at the Southwest Courthouse in Hulen. These guys are gray as their name suggests. They also have a bit of orange on the bottoms of their wings. They are super small and very fragile. They normally sit without flapping their wings. They sit more like a Wood Nymph when feeding. These guys also have a habit of moving their lower wings together for some reason. They are one of my favorites and one of the easiest to ID. They are unmistakable. They are very common and can be seen in backyards, gardens, plant shops, and pollinator gardens. Anywhere their favorite plants can be found. These were one of the insects on the FFA ID contest list back when I was in high school.

7 September 2015: The long dry spell finally broke in the North Texas area and early today on the morning of September 9, 2015, we got some rain that made the grass look a little greener and the two-weeks long dry rock bed of Cooper Creek filled up with the precious liquid once again. But we were fortunate in that two days earlier we were visited by a Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus) that nectared on one of the cacti’s little red flowers outside and stayed for quite a long time past sunset. This was the first time that we documented Gray Hairstreak in the Avondale Park and Cooper Creek habitat that comprises it. A welcomed visitor, this observation presents three different digital images that were taken of this butterfly. The last previous rainfall we’d had in this area of the North Texas metropolitan area was around June 15, 2015, nearly three months ago. The forecast for this weekend’s weather has the temperature gauge falling to the mid- and high-eighties. It looks like there’s a change coming and the trees are beginning to dress the part. Avondale Park and Cooper Creek are administered by the City of Denton, Texas.","Avondale Park, Denton, Texas",33.242657,-97.109358,"Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus), Avondale Park, Denton, Texas, Cooper Creek, butterflies, hairstreaks, summer, rainfall, City of Denton, North Texas","Gray Hairstreak","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1932204","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/2363923/medium.jpg?1441862521","aguilita",1932204,"Gray Hairstreak","Insecta",50931,"false",3,0,"2015-09-07","2015-09-07","","Central Time (US & Canada)",307,"","","false","","",NA,115129,"2015-09-09 22:21:57 -0700","2017-09-25 20:14:31 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
