"Heraclides rumiko","2017-03-13 14:50:00 -0500","Eastern Giant Swallowtail or Western Giant Swallowtail. I am aware of the published information about how to separate Eastern and Western Giant Swallowtail which may be seen at the below link. Until that was published recently it was just considered one species. In central Texas I am often finding individuals that seem to have one character suggesting Eastern while another character suggests Western. The differences seem easy to see in the published info, but in the field and in photos of real individuals, I am seeing lots of ambiguity and overlap. Bottom line is I do not currently trust my own IDs as to Eastern or Western in central Texas and will leave this ID to others who are better at it than I am. I would welcome anyone who can ID these to weigh in as I just don't feel confident with the field ID to species level at all. In addition there are many known hybrids in central Texas. I surrender. These were formerly considered to be in the genus Heraclides, but by the nomenclature iNat uses in the Pelham catalog, they are in the genus Papilio. 
http://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=4409 
The authors of that publication state “Many specimens in central Texas exhibit intermediate characters, atypical character combinations, and possible hybrids can be found”. 
The following record will provide some more information if anyone is interested:
http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/4476330

Interestingly, I have noted that some other observers in the Austin area tend to label all their giant swallowtails as Eastern (and others on iNat will agree with that ID) while other observers tend to label all of their giant swallowtails as Western (and others on iNat will agree with that ID).  Many of these are from the same locations. Maybe it’s just me, but I find this unrealistic. But again, maybe it’s just me.

"Heraclides rumiko","2016-03-13 16:30:00 -0500","I find it difficult to ID the Giant Swallowtails, but this ID is based on the information in the article by Shiraiwa, Cong, and Grishin in ZooKeys 468: 85-135 (23 Dec 2014) where they describe H. rumiko. The yellow stripes on the neck is visible in two of the pictures here, and the spots on the fore wing seems to match too.
