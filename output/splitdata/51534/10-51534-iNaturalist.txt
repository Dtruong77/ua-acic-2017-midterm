"Leptotes cassius","2015-10-01 00:00:00 -0600","This female Cassius Blue was dancing around and ovipositing on the flowering tips of this Native Plumbago.  My point-and-shoot camera was over-compensating the exposure so the butterfly is terribly washed out.  On the close-up images of the flowering tip, you can see one egg tucked behind the flower bracts just 1/4"" back from the tip.

My thanks to @sambiology for identifying the plant, Plumbago scandens:

I'll have to do some research to see if Plumbago is a known larval host for this species. (* See comment below.)","Calusa Shell Mound Trail, J. R.
