9 October 2015: Walked about Sandy Point (aka Sandy Day Use Area) at the Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge (HNWR), Sherman, Texas, on a day when the wind was blowing strong off of Lake Texoma and the skies were cloudy and promising of rain but did not release any water except for the occasional sprinkle. There were far too many small to tiny moths and butterflies flying at Sandy Point for any one person alone to document all of them so I ended up taking my pick in the time we had and we had the entire Sandy Point area to ourselves which was wonderful. And this Dainty Sulphur (Nathalis iole) was likely the smallest of these butterflies present at Sandy Point on this day and much like the rest of them was focused on staying still and holding onto something, like grass and plant stems, to keep from being blown away by the stiff wind or at least (and very wisely) not having to fly and unnecessarily expend energy under such conditions. The substantial cover provided by the thick grass undercover acted as a windbreaker and so these flying Lepidoptera were seeking the lower elevations among the grass and plants at the site to best ride out the windy conditions and thus conserve their energy to do more important things later. Sentient, we think yes. Smart? Definitely.

What caught our eye about the many Dainty Sulphurs was their incredibly large number as they were easily the most numerous Lepidoptera flying at Sandy Point on this day. We had not had the opportunity previously to document Dainty Sulphur and so this made our encounter special on this day. It was also the first time we documented or photographed Dainty Sulphur at the HNWR. Among the smaller butterflies also flying on this day at this site that we were able to identify were Phaon Crescent and Pearl Crescent.
 
We thank our BugGuide (Department of Entomology, Iowa State University) colleagues for making the IDentification of this Dainty Sulphur possible especially Mike Hoffman for his generous assistance. The ID from BugGuide can be accessed here: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1154619

Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge is administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Department of the Interior.
