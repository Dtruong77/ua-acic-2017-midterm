"Brephidium exilis","2009-11-08 09:56:00 -0800","One of the things I like about birding is that I usually put my camera away and just ... look at stuff.  It makes me realize how much of my time I often spend thinking about images and not the subjects of those images: what they look like <em>now</em>, in front of my eyes, how they're reacting, moving, changing.  In many ways the camera helps me slow down and look closer at the world, but I find it important to remember how it can also distract me from the world.

Of course, it's not like I go birding cameraless!  Perish the thought.  While Sarah and I were sorting out our peeps and lamenting the paucity of ducks around Tubbs Island (San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge), we found a ton of these tiny lycaenids.
