"Pieris rapae","2016-02-28 11:25:00 +1300","Many of the cabbage white butterflies' favourite plant species on the 27th feb, for example basil, were today in complete shade. This is due to the suns movement throughout the course of the day, as the 27th feb assessment was at 5:10pm and the 28th feb observation was at 11:20am.

By observing the cabbage white butterfly population behaviour, it is clear that they avoid the shade and prefer areas that are in the sun. This is likely justification for why the Basil wasn't utilised today, and instead the population much more readily gathered nectar from dandelions.

The wind was stronger during the 28th observation, noticeably affecting the butterfly behaviour as the amount of time spent resting was reduced (assumedly due to the increased sway in foliage).

The temperature was also a lot lower on the 28th (19 degrees, as opposed to 31 degrees the previous day). This could also justify the reduction in butterfly numbers","555 Collins road, Sprinston, Christchurch",-43.661748,172.420144,"","Cabbage White","http://naturewatch.org.nz/observations/2722115","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/3071127/medium.jpg?1456614614","james_ranstead",2722115,"Cabbage White","Insecta",55626,"false",1,0,"2016-02-28 11:25 am","2016-02-28","2016-02-27 15:25:00 -0700","Wellington",NA,"","","false","","",NA,183822,"2016-02-27 16:10:10 -0700","2016-05-13 22:45:46 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"

Human presence, and the addition of toxins nearby to the site may have altered the species behaviour.

The garden contained species that are required for the larval stage, such as broccoli, and there was cabbage present about a week ago. This is perhaps the reason the local population is so large.
