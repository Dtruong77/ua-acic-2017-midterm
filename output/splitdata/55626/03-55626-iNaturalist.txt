The butterflies were landing within the flowers and extending their proboscis into the center of the flower, making the plant a feeding plant. After a visit to an individual bloom, another butterfly was not deterred from this bloom and would also feed from the same bloom. Additionally, butterflies would sometimes compete for/share the same bloom.
Removed from the plant, the butterflies would sometimes hover over other species of plants, including blooms, but not land on them. The butterflies would circle/interact with each other in the air, sometimes make circles around the lawn or fly straight up to the sky at roof height (single story).

"Pieris rapae","2016-03-01 17:30:00 +1300","The exact location is in a fairly suburban area, closely surrounded by farmland. The temperature was 15 degrees Celsius and it was fairly windy (Beaufort 2), with no precipitation. It began as a mild to cool day with overcast, and by late afternoon the sun came out. The observed space is approx. 3 square meters and situated in the corner of two low rise buildings, facing to the west. 

The butterflies interaction toward the plants varied. There were two instances where butterflies landed on the flowering shrub, Convolvulus cneorum, The butterflies were observed sticking their proboscis into numerous flowers. Also, judging by the amount of honeybees present on the Convolvulus cneorum, it can be assumed that this plant is mainly used for feeding on nectar. However, the taller bush (species unknown) had no blooms and the butterflies seemed more attracted to this location. The bush was observed to be attractive as a resting spot. The butterflies would not extend their proboscis when they landed. The butterflies were also landing, and then opening their wings to the west (the setting sun), so as to absorb the warmth of the sun on the previously cool day perhaps. 

The butterflies were hovering around the bush and flying up to the height of the roof and then back down to the bush. There were no instances of the butterflies landing anywhere but on the plants.

The butterflies rarely appeared individually, but as pairs. There was one pair that interacted and danced around each other.

They were seen doing a variety of different activities, however many were seen flying between plantlife and resting for only small amounts of time. They seemed very \energetic\ and there was very little resting for long periods of time to be seen.

Site notes: Conditions were ideal for butterfly activity as it was warm and sunny. There were some clouds visible at the begginning of the 20 minute interval but this burnt off quickly and the number of butterflies in the area became evident.
