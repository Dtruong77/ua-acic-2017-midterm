"Pieris rapae","2017-05-16 13:28:00 -0700","The butterfly Pieris rapae, or most commonly known as the cabbage white, is very common in Europe and North American and also Wallowa County. They are also found in Asia and almost any man made area. Pieris rapae belongs to the Animalia kingdom because it is multicellular and is a heterotroph that relies on other organisms for food. It is part of the phylum Arthropoda because it is invertebrate with a segmented body, joined legs, and contains an exoskeleton. The class that Pieris rapae is placed in is Insecta. This class has three main body parts, six legs, and two antennae. The rapae species is in the order Lepidoptera because it means to have scales and wings, just like moths and butterflies. This butterfly is a member of the Pieris family and is most commonly known as the Cabbage White. 
All butterflies go through a morphological stage through metamorphosis. The insect first starts as an egg and moults and turns into a pupa through time. After rising from the pupa stage, the organism grows and becomes and adult butterfly. Pieris rapae begin as yellow egg with 12 longitudinal ridges that are places singularly on their host plant. As young caterpillars, they are bluish-green with tiny black pints. They also have a black ring around the spiracles, a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow middorsal line. The pupa of Pieris rapae are brown, gray, and yellowish to match the background of their surroundings. It has a large head cone, with a vertical abdomen and flared sub dorsal ridge. The pupa begin to grow into adults in the chrysalis and will later emerge as adult butterflies. 
Pieris rapae can be easily identified from its other family members. Many other members of the Pieris family consist of marbling on the underside of the hindwing. In comparison, Cabbage Whites do not have those certain characteristics, but do have some of their very own. They are most commonly known for their bright white or yellow color and their famous dots on their wings. Females have two black dots on their lower forewings with one dot on their upper hindwing, while males only have one dot on each wing. The Cabbage White is the only species of its family that has both unmarked hindwing undersides and at least one black spot on the forewing upper side and the leading edge of the hindwing upper side. They’re wingspan usually ranges from 30 to 50 mm long and this specimen had a wingspan of 40mm. 
Pieris rapae are usually adults from the months of March to October and are most commonly seen within that time. Butterflies reproduce sexually. When a male spots a female, the butterfly zig zags and flies around her until she lands. The male flutters, catches her closed forewings with his legs, and spreads his wings. He usually flies a short distance with her beneath him. The male passes a small pack of sperm to the female.  Each egg gets fertilized while the sperm passes through the egg laying tube. Female butterflies will lay their eggs singularly on their host plants using the oils from mustard plants. 
My specimen was found near the hostplants that they live on. It was found in a residential backyard, fluttering around the garden bed. The bed was located in Enterprise, Oregon. The Cabbage White was found on a sunny day when the skies were blue. There were also other species in my back yard surrounding the butterfly I collected. There were dandelions, grass, cabbages, and raspberry plants. It was one of the most common areas Cabbage Whites are found along with man made areas, in town, and valley ranges. The GPS coordinates were 45o25’19”N, 117o16’18”W on the East aspect. This specimen has adapted to its surroundings through time. It is a male with more of a bright white color which allowed it to blend in with its surroundings. He did not stand out intensively and this trait would allow him to hide from predators. The colors of Cabbage Whites are crucial in order to blend in with their habitat.
