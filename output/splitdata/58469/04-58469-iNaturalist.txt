16 April 2016
Ray Roberts Lake State Park - Johnson
Valley View, Cooke County, Texas

Note: With many thanks for the prompt and accurate ID provided by Dr. Cliff Ivy, Contributing Editor, BugGuide, Department of Entomology, Iowa State University. The BugGuide ID may be accessed here: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1211725

At the same site where we observed Wild Indigo Duskywing nectaring on Common Vetch was this other skipper doing the same, Northern Cloudywing. And while observations in Texas of Northern Cloudywing are relatively more common than those of Wild Indigo Duskywing, they are still an uncommon event. Interestingly, more observations have been made of Northern Cloudywing on iNaturalist for Texas than have been made respectively to BugGuide. The first Texas observation to BugGuide of Northern Cloudywing was made in 2008. Since then a total of only four observations of Northern Cloudywing have been reported and vetted or confirmed on BugGuide including our own. The counties reporting to BugGuide with confirmed sightings of Northern Cloudywing between 2008 and 2016 include Cooke, Dallas and Kerr counties. Between 2012 and 2016, by comparison, sightings by individuals (and not institutions) of Northern Cloudywing in Texas on iNaturalist came to a total of at least 31 individual sightings (excluding the Livermore Ranch observations which are numerous and exceptional).  And these have been made by about 21 separate individuals by our quick count and all of these persons of course are and/or have been active on iNaturalist. So a far more consequential activity by persons associated with iNaturalist in Texas has occurred when reporting on Northern Cloudywing is concerned than has been true on BugGuide since its first observation of this species was confirmed for Texas in 2008. Together, about 25 individual naturalists have reported separate and sometimes multiple confirmed sightings of Northern Cloudywing in Texas since 2008 (BugGuide) and 2012 (iNaturalist) respectively. Hence we add our own observation of Northern Cloudywing for Cooke County which is this county’s first confirmed sighting for this species at the referenced sites. And we do so by making our observation to both online sites.

Northern Cloudywing has an expansive flight range in North America. It flies in central and eastern provinces in Canada and flies throughout most of the eastern United States, as well as several of its Midwestern and Western states as far west as California, for example. It’s possible that Northern Cloudywing flies as far as the border with Mexico’s northern states (and beyond) given its range reported by BugGuide and thus likely occurs there as well. Because of its extensive indigenous presence throughout North America, Northern Cloudywing is an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. Ray Roberts Lake State Park – Johnson, is administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

Here's the classification for Northern Cloudywing offered on BugGuide:
