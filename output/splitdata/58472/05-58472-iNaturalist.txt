"Thorybes bathyllus","2017-05-13 00:00:00 -0600","Day two at the Pat Mayse WMA BioBlitz with good friends from throughout Texas. I joined about 20 folks at this Wildlife Management Area to document as much as possible, and it was fantastic. I did try to document a few things, but more important for me, I got to spend time with some of my favorite naturalists in the whole world. As I go through each of these, I smile. :)

In the morning, Some of us went to the area by the ponds to explore.  We noticed quite a few dragonflies and some pretty interesting plants.","Pat Mayse WMA, Texas",33.810572,-95.69442,"","Southern Cloudywing","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6267523","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/7883799/medium.jpeg?1495160860","sambiology",6267523,"Southern Cloudywing","Insecta",58472,"false",1,0,"2017-05-13","2017-05-13","","Central Time (US & Canada)",3,"",NA,"false","","",NA,22589,"2017-05-18 19:27:35 -0700","2017-05-18 20:09:54 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
