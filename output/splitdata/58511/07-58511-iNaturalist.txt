An uncommon butterfly in the DFW area, I've been told has only been found in two places and one of those places is somewhere I regularly visit so I've seen several.  I have found them on 3 different kinds of flowers, all of which are in the same area.  This is one favorite, pickerelweed.  These butterflies like a nice marshy area.
