Medina River Natural Area 
San Antonio, Béxar County, Texas

Note: This was an exceptional park and/or natural area. Our tree and shrub IDs were obtained from the extensive educational markers found at the site. Lots of thought and resources went into making sure that the ninety-some educational markers found throughout the site occur naturally where the trees and shrubs that are described are part of the existing landscape. The Medina River Natural Area is administered by the City of San Antonio, Texas.
 
This Dun Skipper was feeding on flowers at the entrance garden to the site.","Medina River Natural Area, San Antonio, Texas",29.25716,-98.569915,"Dun Skipper (Euphyes vestris), skippers, butterflies, Lepidoptera, insects, spring, South Texas, North America, Western Hemisphere","Dun Skipper","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6342077","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/7993149/medium.jpg?1495602601","aguilita",6342077,"Dun Skipper","Insecta",58514,"false",1,0,"2017-04-02","2017-04-02","","Central Time (US & Canada)",NA,"","","false","","",NA,115129,"2017-05-23 22:09:57 -0700","2017-05-27 19:11:55 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"

I sure had a nice time going to some places I hadn’t been before.  I wasn’t able to stay out all day (family stuff this evening), but I did see quite a few things I hadn’t seen before.  

Will work on all of these ID’s later on – just wanted to upload them first.

Locations approximate for each observation (normally I try to get a little more specific, but I was all over the place on these days!).
