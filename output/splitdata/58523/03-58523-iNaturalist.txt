This thing was different from the pipevine and the Eastern Tiger Swallowtails. It took me a few attempts but finally this guy decided to land and I was able to get a few photos of him. He was laying in the grass where there were no flowers to feed on. His wings were spread out which is the way I like my butterfly photos. The back wing is so much more important than the underside but both can be good for ID marks but to get the good stuff it is the upper part of the wing that is the good stuff. This one was mainly black with a series of yellow dots going in a series of two rows on the back of the wing. This guy was already showing some signs of some wear and tear but still very impressive to see. This is my third swallowtail species that I have photographed. This one is a really nice one. However the Eastern Tiger so far has been chalked up on my favorites bar but this one is nothing to sneeze at it is beautiful too. It is very pretty to look at.
