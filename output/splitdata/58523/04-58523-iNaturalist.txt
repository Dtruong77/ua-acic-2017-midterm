"Papilio polyxenes","2017-04-25 14:08:00 -0500","Found this one on one of the yellow plants. I have seen these Caterpillars before but I am not sure what kind of Swallowtail this Caterpillar belongs. This one is one of the more common of caterpillars i look for and often see. This thing was just hanging on for dear life in the bluster of the wind. It was hard to get a photo at times. I had to have my dad hold the plant stem to get it to stop shaking around. I don't know why it took me so long to post these but I am doing it now. I hate it when I have back draft observations on the back burner. Sometimes I just have a hard time with late photos.

Medina River Natural Area 
San Antonio, Béxar County, Texas

Note: This was an exceptional park and/or natural area. Our tree and shrub IDs were obtained from the extensive educational markers found at the site. Lots of thought and resources went into making sure that the ninety-some educational markers found throughout the site occur naturally where the trees and shrubs that are described are part of the existing landscape. The Medina River Natural Area is administered by the City of San Antonio, Texas.
