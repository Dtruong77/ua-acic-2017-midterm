While I did notice a very obvious absence of honeybees  — I usually see at least 6 - 10 any time I'm near my garden — there were a very typical number and species of butterflies., including 3 Silver Spotted Skippers, 1 Great Spangled Fritillary, 1 Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,  2 Spicebush Swallowtails, and 3 little brown butterflies — Skippers or Dashes that I couldn't identify quickly.
