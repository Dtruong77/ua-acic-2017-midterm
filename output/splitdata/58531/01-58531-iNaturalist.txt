Images 1-2: Female
Images 3-4: Male

Note: The digital images we captured last January 30, 2016, during the early- and mid-afternoon were IDentified by David J. Ferguson, a Contributing Editor at BugGuide, and who is currently a curator at the Rio Grande Botanic Garden in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We thank David for his IDs of these butterfly specimens. Once we obtained the IDs from David and BugGuide we realized that we had photographed the male on the east bank of Delaware Creek at Centennial Park in Irving, Texas, and the female on the west bank of the same creek some minutes later. Our recollection is that this was the only butterfly species flying on this day at Centennial Park, Clouded Sulphur (Colias philodice). The exceptionally warm winter temperature in the North Texas metro area reached 72 degrees Fahrenheit on the date of our observation. Again, we documented Clouded Sulphur per BugGuide's and David J. Ferguson's ID and the respective IDs may be accessed here:

Clouded Sulphur (Colias philodice), Male: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1187836
Clouded Sulphur (Colias philodice), Female: http://bugguide.net/node/view/1187834

As our iNaturalist and lepidoptera colleagues know, Clouded Sulphur is a rare occurrence in Texas and BugGuide has only three confirmed IDs (documented sightings) on their data map that they provide for Texas dating back to April 2012 with one having occurred in Travis County (near Austin), and another in April 2014 in Dallas County (DeSoto). So our iNat observation would be significant in this regard and especially since David J. Ferguson identified that we documented both genders of the species. Ours would therefore be the third documented sighting of this species in Texas per BugGuide and the first to have been documented in January. This would also constitute the second Dallas County BugGuide-IDentified Clouded Sulphur between April 2014 and January 2016.
