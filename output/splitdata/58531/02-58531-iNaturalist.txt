"Colias philodice","2017-02-23 09:53:00 -0600","This was one I forgot to upload from the TCC file. This little fellow was feeding on a Dandelion. These Butterflies all look the same to me I can't tell them apart half the time. These guys are absolutely beautiful but I have a hard time identifying them. This one was a dusty light green and had some reddish color in the eyes spot and patterns. It even had a black tip on the very top of the wings. I love butterflies and can ID most of them but these guys not so much. This guy was flying around and pollinating these flowers as I was walking with my mother around the exercise track.
