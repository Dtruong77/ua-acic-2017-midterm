Greenbelt Corridor Ray Roberts/Lewisville Lake FM 428 Access Area, Aubrey Branch
Denton County, Texas

Eufala Skipper's flight in the US extends from California to Florida and goes as far north as Oklahoma, Tennessee, and South Carolina, but it extends its flight farther north under the proper seasonal conditions. According to Butterflies and Moths of North America, Eufala Skipper's range makes it a resident of ""coastal Georgia south through Florida and west across the southern United States to southern California; south through Mexico and Central America to Patagonia. Expands its range northward in the summer to central California, North Dakota, southern Wisconsin, northern Michigan, and Washington, D.C."" Hence its range is variable and constant at the same time and extends throughout the Americas including Mexico, Central America, and South America including its most southern regions in Chile and Argentina otherwise known as Patagonia. Because of its extensive flight across the Americas, Eufala Skipper is easily an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. The Greenbelt Corridor FM 428 Access Area is administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
