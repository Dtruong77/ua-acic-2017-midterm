This one was huge and he would fly around for a bit then after a while land at this spot to drink. This was a very interesting photo that I took after school today. Today has just been one surprise after another. This Swallowtail had black on the tops of his wings and on the outline of the side of the wings. He had dark stripes going downward on the upper wing. It was absolutely absolutely beautiful and amazing. This thing was huge. This is by far one of my favorite butterfly species. Mainly they are just a black and yellow butterfly. This is another early bird insect to come out this winter. This weird weather we have been having has really brought an interesting bunch of insects to come out an play. It is very weird. We are still in the middle of winter right? I am so confused.
