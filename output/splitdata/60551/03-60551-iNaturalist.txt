I ID'ed this butterfly as an Eastern Tiger Swallowtail which put on a beautiful show for us as it flew around us and didn't fly away as we got closer to it. 

Oak Mountain State park had a variety of species unique to the south that are currently in the rehabilitation center within the park that I wish I took pictures of such as a few owls and birds
