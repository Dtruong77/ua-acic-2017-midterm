"Papilio glaucus","2017-07-30 16:02:07 -0400","During our trip to Hocking Hills, my friend and I were walking along a small creek. On the sand bank, we saw a group of these magnificent butterflies known as Eastern Tiger Swallowtails. I estimated that there were around a dozen of these beautiful creatures. However, despite the beauty of these, they were in the act of what scientist call, mud-puddling. This is where large groups of mostly male butterflies will assemble aground smelly mud, animal urine, or dung. One observation that has been made is, while these butterflies drink from the mud/sand, liquid is pumped from their abdomens. You can see this in the last picture (a small droplet formed at the very tip of the abdomen). This was a mystifying experience even though I may have been laying in animal excretions in order to get these pictures!","43138, Logan, OH, US",39.4659503601,-82.4884364233,"","Eastern Tiger Swallowtail","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7586676","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/9910798/medium.jpg?1503329129","laurasimon",7586676,"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail","Insecta",60551,"false",1,0,"Sun Jul 30 2017 16:02:07 GMT-0400 (EDT)","2017-07-30","2017-07-30 13:02:07 -0700","Eastern Time (US & Canada)",1490,"","","false","","","false",594902,"2017-08-21 08:24:34 -0700","2017-08-21 08:31:58 -0700","research","",3,"false"

Denton County, Texas

We had the unexpected experience of having not one but two Eastern Tiger Swallowtails appear almost simultaneously by the side of the trail, with one being the dark morph of the species and the other the light form. The dark morph appeared first, followed immediately by the appearance of its alter ego, the light-colored form of the species. And they perched with their wings fully extended under the canopied setting. We provide observations of each one separately. The dark morph did not remain long though, and before we could pull out the second camera that had a flash to take its pic with, it had effortlessly flitted off into the denser portion of the wooded area. The canopy was formed by a dense stand of Cedar Elm and it is this tree's lower branches that the two tigers respectively chose to perch on. The light form Eastern Tiger Swallowtail stayed a bit longer and we were able to take its pic using both cameras including the one with the flash. And thus we present one pic each of it with and without the flash; the look and feel of the respective images is distinct but evocative just the same. Greenbelt Park 428 is administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

We had the unexpected experience of having not one but two Eastern Tiger Swallowtails appear almost simultaneously by the side of the trail, with one being the dark morph of the species and the other the light form. The dark morph appeared first, followed immediately by the appearance of its alter ego, the light-colored form of the species. And they perched with their wings fully extended under the canopied setting. We provide observations of each one separately. The dark morph did not remain long though, and before we could pull out the second camera that had a flash to take its pic with, it had effortlessly flitted off into the denser portion of the wooded area. The canopy was formed by a dense stand of Cedar Elm and it is this tree's lower branches that the two tigers respectively favored. The light form Eastern Tiger Swallowtail stayed a bit longer and we were able to take its pic using both cameras including the one with the flash. And thus we present one pic each of it with and without the flash; the look of the images is distinct but evocative just the same. Greenbelt Park 428 is administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
