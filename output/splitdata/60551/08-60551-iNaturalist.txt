26 August 2015: Walked the hard rock creek bed of Cooper Creek for a distance from Avondale Park downstream nearly a half mile and examined the remaining water holes. No rain in the near-term forecast. Most of the Bluegill, Western Mosquitofish, Black Bullhead, and other species that inhabit the creek are nearly entirely gone due to the predation of the big aquatic birds (Yellow-crowned Night Heron, Snowy Egret, Great White Egret, and Cattle Egret) who have been frequenting the creek’s fast-disappearing water holes and leaving fewer fish each day that passes in what remains of the water. For the big birds it’s a time of plenty, for the fish this is the end of the line. They shall fly as big birds in their next lives. It’s the circle of life. We are reminded that these are ancient human beliefs that get recycled and repackaged for each succeeding generation. To a greater or lesser degree, this is the crisis of Cooper Creek every late summer in August and the start of September, when the rains will most likely finally come. It’s the start of the hurricane season and reports in the media indicate that the Gulf of Mexico’s first hurricane is barreling across a portion of the Caribbean and may even touch a portion of the Florida peninsula by Monday at the latest. But on Cooper Creek even the turtles have left. Perhaps they walked to find places with greater levels of water (things that only turtles know) or have dug themselves into the soft mud banks of the creek to await the rains and are hunkered down with their nose to the wind anticipating the precious liquid.

On our return walk after having surveyed this scene we encountered this magnificently large male Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) flying over the creek bed. It was looking to perch first on one side and then the next and eventually stopped numerous times on different branches of the predominant shrubs found on the creek’s banks. It allowed us plenty of time to take some digital images (presented above). We left it perched on the side of the creek content to have had our walk generously recognized in this way by this wandering winged lord of the skies. More frequent are the times when they will not stop for you or anyone or anything headed somewhere else far more important and filled with purpose or so it would seem. And then as if this was the appointed day and the appointed hour, there it is, and there you are, and yes, this is the time to commune, to artfully dance and mutually recognize one another. And so it was today during the late afternoon while elsewhere on Cooper Creek and Avondale Park the Dusky Dancers were busy procreating and appeared in force at several of the creek’s remaining water holes depositing their eggs on submerged leaf matter as if there was no tomorrow. But we will post their image and story soon enough in another separate observation. So once again we had an encounter with a butterfly: a large swallowtail, the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail. And it was a good thing. It always is. Cooper Creek and Avondale Park are administered by the City of Denton, Texas.

The Eastern Tiger Swallowtail is a North American butterfly. It occurs mostly in the eastern half of the United States and the North Texas region is located at a point of its westernmost range in this respect. Its range extends northward into the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada.  Because of its North American presence one can certainly consider the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere.
