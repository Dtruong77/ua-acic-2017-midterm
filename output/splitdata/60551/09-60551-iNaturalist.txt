Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) - male

2 September 2015: On a late afternoon hike through the once again accessible Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center (CCNHC) in Denton, Texas, we came upon a Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) full of blooms and butterflies. There were several other Buttonbushes on the edge of the wetlands lake at the CCNHC but this one had attracted a bounty of butterflies including Queens, Monarchs, Pipevine Swallowtails, male and female Eastern Tiger Swallowtails (Papilio glaucus), and an assortment of bees and wasps. The Eastern Tiger Swallowtails were the most amenable to having their digital images taken and the images in this observation represent those of a dark morph female that was taking nectar at this large Bottonbush which had the semblance of being a tree. The historic rains of the spring of 2015 (and of May 2015 in particular) appear to be behind us now and the trails are passable though the clearing of all the downed trees and washed out parts of the various trails remains to be done. The work appears to be advancing though and as things stand currently no obstacle is too great to impede one’s passage. Because there’s been no rain since the middle of June in the area the ground once wet is now dried and cracked, broken into countless pieces like a giant jigsaw puzzle. Several species of dragonflies were flying in the immediate area next to the butterflies and all along the Wetlands Trail adjoining the wetlands lake including Widow Skimmers, Common Whitetails, Eastern Pondhawks, Blue Dashers and Variegated Meadowhawks. Among the damselflies the most numerous were the Orange Bluets which were making the most of the late afternoon sun to lay their precious eggs along the shore of the seasonally changing wetlands lake. The wetlands lake at the CCNHC is currently filled to capacity and its shoreline is but a few feet distant from the trails. We were glad to have had our second encounter in as many weeks with the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail. A week ago we posted our observation of a large male Eastern Tiger Swallowtail. Today we present a more worn male than the one we observed last week. We enjoyed our hike and in the course of the three-mile course we encountered only one other person who was out making the trek. The CCNHC is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.

Note: What we refer to as the Wetlands Trail in our note above is referred to as the Rookery Trail and Duck Trail in the Google map used by iNat.

Female (dark morph)

2 September 2015: On a late afternoon hike through the once again accessible Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center (CCNHC) in Denton, Texas, we came upon a Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) full of blooms and butterflies. There were several other Buttonbushes on the edge of the wetlands lake at the CCNHC but this one had attracted a bounty of butterflies including Queens, Monarchs, Pipevine Swallowtails, male and female Eastern Tiger Swallowtails (Papilio glaucus), and an assortment of bees and wasps.  The Eastern Tiger Swallowtails were the most amenable to having their digital images taken and the images in this observation represent those of a dark morph female that was taking nectar at this large Bottonbush which had the semblance of being a tree. The historic rains of the spring of 2015 (and of May 2015 in particular) appear to be behind us now and the trails are passable though the clearing of all the downed trees and washed out parts of the various trails remains to be done. The work appears to be advancing though and as things stand currently no obstacle is too great to impede one’s passage. Because there’s been no rain since the middle of June in the area the ground once wet is now dried and cracked, broken into countless pieces like a giant jigsaw puzzle. Several species of dragonflies were flying in the immediate area next to the butterflies and all along the Wetlands Trail adjoining the wetlands lake including Widow Skimmers, Common Whitetails, Eastern Pondhawks, Blue Dashers and Variegated Meadowhawks. Among the damselflies the most numerous were the Orange Bluets which were making the most of the late afternoon sun to lay their precious eggs along the shore of the seasonally changing wetlands lake.  The wetlands lake at the CCNHC is currently filled to capacity and its shoreline is but a few feet distant from the trails. We were glad to have had our second encounter in as many weeks with the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail. A week ago we posted our observation of a large male Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, today we present the dark morph female. We enjoyed our hike and in the course of the three-mile course we encountered only one other person who was out making the trek. We practically had the nature preserve to ourselves or so it seemed. The CCNHC is administered by the City of Denton, Texas.
