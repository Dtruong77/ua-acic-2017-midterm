When disturbed they flitted off the vegetation in a rapid, erratic, swirling flight but then landed back on their territorial perch and rubbed their hindwings together. This is a ""false head"" type of defensive behavior that draws potential predators to the tailed hindwings instead of the anterior end of the animal.
