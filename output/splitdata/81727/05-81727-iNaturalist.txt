We encountered Sleepy Orange while walking the Far Reaches Trail. This particular specimen did not want us to get close to it in order to take its picture. So we gave chase and came up with this image. It became the last of the seven butterfly species we photographed at the site during our hike. We saw at least two or three other butterfly species that we were unable to document.","Government Canyon State Natural Area, San Antonio, Texas",29.549341,-98.764815,"Sleepy Orange (Abaeis nicippe), butterflies, spring, South Texas, North America, Western Hemisphere","Sleepy Orange","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6853983","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/8733525/medium.jpg?1498781411","aguilita",6853983,"Sleepy Orange","Insecta",81727,"false",4,0,"2017-05-29","2017-05-29","","Central Time (US & Canada)",NA,"","","false","","",NA,115129,"2017-06-29 17:10:06 -0700","2017-06-30 22:41:29 -0700","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"
