News of the Lepidopterists’ Society    Volume 57, Number 2

The Sleepy Orange Transits the Pacific: a new butterfly species for Hawaii 

Abaeis (Eurema) nicippe (Cramer, 1779), native to the
Americas, is widespread from the southern tier of the
regularly strays well north of its permanent range, rarely
reaching Canada. The species overwinters as an adult,
and has two forms which are most easily distinguished
by coloration of the underside of the wings: light yellow
in summer and reddish-brown in winter, both with dark
brown maculation. The larval host plants, various species
of Senna, are widely planted as ornamentals.

On December 23, 2013, R. McGough observed A. nicippe
adults and pupae on Senna in the town of Waialua, on the
North Shore of the island of Oahu. This represents only
the third pierid species to become established in Hawaii;
the two others are Pieris rapae, which was introduced
over a century ago, and Phoebis agarithe detected in 2004 (HDOA, 2005).

A. nicippe was sighted again on Oahu in February 2014,
and then quickly became relatively common, with sightings
across the island in 2014, including in the city of Honolulu.
By October 2014, A. nicippe was extremely abundant on
Maui, with an egg seen by F. and K. Starr on Cassia sp .By the end 
of 2014 the butterfly was seen or collected on Kauai, 
Molokai, Big Island, and even the tiny island of
Kahoolawe. Sightings occurred from sea level up to at least
6,800 feet on the slopes of Haleakala on Maui. This rapid
expansion across the Hawaiian Islands demonstrates the
strong dispersal ability of A. nicippe. It is remarkable how
quickly and thoroughly A. nicippe spread throughout the
archipelago, especial considering the high levels of single
island endemism in many native groups of Hawaiian
Lepidoptera (e.g. Haines et al. 2014), which suggest that
populations frequently become isolated on islands.
