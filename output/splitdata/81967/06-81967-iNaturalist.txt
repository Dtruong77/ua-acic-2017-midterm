    -Only single line on the inner wing versus the 2 seen on an Eastern
    -Postmedian band with minimal offset
    -Hindwing chevrons very jagged

Location seems viable as seen just off roadside at parking for Bat Lake Trail. The most common spot in the park to spot Western is the Old Airfield, and Bat Lake parking is effectively across road from there.
