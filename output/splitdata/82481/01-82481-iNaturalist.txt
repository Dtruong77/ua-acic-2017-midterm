"Pieris marginalis","2016-01-27 12:08:40 -0800","Taxonomy question - From 2007 CA Natural History Guide, I thought this was what the book calls a ""Gray-veined White"" (Pieris ""napi complex"" in the book, p. 107 and Plate 5). Season is right, and milkmaids were present. But I'm not sure I picked the right name on iNat, since the book says the true Pieris napi is a European species.
